 Actor Keanu Reeves at the press conference for Henry's Crime at the Hyatt Regency (Image: Karon Liu) 
 What was possibly the most awkward hour of TIFF so far took place yesterday at the press conference for the new  Keanu Reeves  vehicle  Henry’s Crime,  a  rom-com about an average Joe who robs a bank after spending three years  in jail after being falsely accused of robbing said bank. The room was  packed full of photographers and reporters, yet for nearly 30 minutes,  moderator  Robert Gray  was met with nothing but shutter clicks every time he asked if anyone had any questions to ask the movie’s cast and director. 
 Perhaps to break the silence or to help out Gray, who was running out of  questions, people started to ask Reeves questions that had nothing to  do with the movie. They inquired about his favourite restaurant in  Toronto (it’s been 20 years since he moved from Yorkville to L.A.), if  he’s involved with any Canadian productions (no, but he’d like to), if  he has ever been mistaken for another celebrity ( Morgan Freeman , quipped co-star  James Caan ), and when he last watched  The Matrix.  We would have asked if  Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey  was going to get a remake, but fortunately, mercifully, the conference ended.

 This type thing happened to Robert DeNiro’s much anticipated film “Stone” also. and many more films. it was written that the TIFF’s local media was not completely prepaired, who knows, but keanu’s movie was not alone in this. There is video of DeNiro being so frustrated that the press at his “Stone” movie press conference had not seen his film, that Robert DeNiro got smart alecky!  when asked a question. Lol!!! Keanu didnot do this,thankfully,  he was as charming as ever.
