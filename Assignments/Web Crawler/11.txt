That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved.

Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors.

The goal is to  fix all broken links on the web .

Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites.

Collection:  Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)  	  This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages.

The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to.

This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to  rid the web of broken links .

Sign up for our TIFF newsletter for daily updates during the festival TIFF       1  Comment Keanu Reeves bears witness to TIFF’s most awkward moment yet     Actor Keanu Reeves at the press conference for Henry's Crime at the Hyatt Regency (Image: Karon Liu) What was possibly the most awkward hour of TIFF so far took place yesterday at the press conference for the new  Keanu Reeves  vehicle  Henry’s Crime,  a  rom-com about an average Joe who robs a bank after spending three years  in jail after being falsely accused of robbing said bank.

The room was  packed full of photographers and reporters, yet for nearly 30 minutes,  moderator  Robert Gray  was met with nothing but shutter clicks every time he asked if anyone had any questions to ask the movie’s cast and director.

Perhaps to break the silence or to help out Gray, who was running out of  questions, people started to ask Reeves questions that had nothing to  do with the movie.

They inquired about his favourite restaurant in  Toronto (it’s been 20 years since he moved from Yorkville to L.A.), if  he’s involved with any Canadian productions (no, but he’d like to), if  he has ever been mistaken for another celebrity ( Morgan Freeman , quipped co-star  James Caan ), and when he last watched  The Matrix.

We would have asked if  Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey  was going to get a remake, but fortunately, mercifully, the conference ended.
