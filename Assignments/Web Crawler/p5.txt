 Summary: 
 
 
   "For an actor who's been in so many mega-hits and equally mega misses, it can be tough to track Keanu Reeves's accomplishments. But true fans know that Keanu is so much more than his Bill and Ted persona, both onscreen and off. During his long career--over 30 years, though you wouldn't know it from his immortal looks--he has constantly subverted Hollywood stereotypes and expectations. He's the type to start his own  publishing company, reread Hamlet, write a grown-up children's book, photobomb people's weddings, eat lunch alone in the park while looking very sad, and give away his salary to the film crew.  For Your Consideration: Keanu Reeves examines the ways in which Keanu strives to be kind and excellent in work and in life. The authors also explore various Internet conspiracies about his age, help you identify which Sad Keanu meme you are, give you the Keanu and Winona Ryder fanfic your heart desires, and much, much more."--Amazon.com.

 Publisher Synopsis  
 
 "A pop-culture smorgasbord that reveals the hows and whys of [Keanu Reeves'] staying power in the film industry since "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" (1989)."--Chicago Tribune "Just the right  amount of goofy jokes, paired with surprisingly deep moments that leave you going 'woah.'"--Women Write About Comics"If you're a Keanu Reeves fan, you have to buy this book."--WGN "Fans of Keanu Reeves will absolutely appreciate this book, while those who have a general knowledge of him will definitely enjoy this off-beat look at the man, his career, and the cultural phenomenon he's sparked."--Geeks of Doom"Manages to take a look at one of the most beloved actors of our time...[an] excellent adventure."--BioGamer Girl
