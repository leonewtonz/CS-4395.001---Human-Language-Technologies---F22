The Faculty : Where are they now?

In Robert Rodriguez's 1998 cult classic, The Faculty, a group of students are forced to fight against their teachers who have been infected by an alien parasite.

Inspired by the sci-fi classics Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Puppet Masters, the film managed to gather a massive ensemble cast of Hollywood heavy hitters, up-and-coming actors who would soon become household names, and veterans of the horror genre, creating one of the most unique movies in horror history.

In the years since the film's release, the cast and crew have gone on to a multitude of other projects.

The Matrix Reloaded             Show More About The Matrix Reloaded       type        Movie                 ”The Matrix” is the most influential action movie of its generation.

This is not hyperbole.

It isn’t even a stretch.

The story — in a future where machines have enslaved humans in a virtual reality called the Matrix, a hacker named Neo discovers that his destiny is to lead the resistance — had seismic impact.

And since the movie’s release in March 1999, every 360-degree sweep of a camera, every black-clad hero, every sexy yet deadly heroine, every bullet rippling slowly through the air, is a rip-off that can be traced back to writer-directors Andy and Larry Wachowski.

They made Carrie-Anne Moss.

(”I had no career before,” says the actress.

”None.”) They inspired the most slavish fan worship this side of ”Star Wars.” They triggered countless pale imitations and dull-witted parodies.

They were hailed as geniuses, and for a brief, mad moment, they were even blamed for the shootings at Columbine High School.

”Larry and Andrew shared some of their e-mails and showed me how it was being discussed on the Internet,” says star Keanu Reeves.

”That’s where I started to see [how big the movie was], which was a ways after it came out.”        The Matrix Reloaded              type       Movie               mpaa                     runtime       138 minutes               director       Andy Wachowski   Lana Wachowski                           Comments                               Close this dialog window   Share & More       EW.com         Magazines & More               Learn More   Subscribe  this link opens in a new tab   Advertise  this link opens in a new tab   Content Licensing  this link opens in a new tab   Accolades  this link opens in a new tab     Connect                                   Subscribe to Our Newsletter         Meredith © Copyright 2022 Meredith Corporation.
