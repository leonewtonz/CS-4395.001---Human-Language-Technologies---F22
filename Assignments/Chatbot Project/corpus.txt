neither had i, until it showed up in my mailbox. new rose hotel is a strange, confusing concoction that undoubtedly will leave no lasting impression. new rose hotel tells the story of two men, fox and "x" (christopher walken and willem dafoe) involved in industrial espionage (apparently the get-rich-quick scheme of whenever this movie is set). their specialty is ensuring the defection of research scientists from one japanese mega-corporation to another. their latest target is hiroshi, a geneticist who apparently is next to god himself (or herself, depending on your point of view) in tinkering with nature. fox is convinced that a corporation will pay the men $100 million if they "secure" hiroshi's services. fox and x pay a call girl, sandii (asia argento), $1 million to seduce hiroshi away from his lucrative job and his ball-and-chain wife. during their "training sessions" (consisting of stripping, skinny-dipping, and sex), sandii and x fall "in love." that's the only parts of the plot that were completely clear. and that's about the first fifteen or twenty minutes. the rest of the movie is a mélange of ambiguous plot revelations and writhing naked flesh. reviewing anecdote: the only time i had to examine this movie was an afternoon while my wife was working on her college homework. so, i plugged in my monitor headphones and proceeded to watch the movie. about fifteen minutes from the end of the movie, she moved from the kitchen into the living room to work at the computer. as she watched the television sans sound, she thought i was watching a porn movie, intercut with shots of willem dafoe fondling (and fondling himself with) a handgun. when the movie was over, i was not sure how the plot resolved itself. walken's character jumps from a balcony for no apparent reason. there's some sort of a double-cross, and people die at a research facility, but it's never really spelled out just what happened. it's as if the director, abel ferrara, figured that the plot wasn't important as long as the audience would see generous quantities of asia argento's ample form. lest you think i have a vendetta against new rose hotel, i was actually looking forward to watching it. christopher walken is one of my favorite character actors. i think he first came to my attention as michelle pfeiffer's creepy boss in batman returns. since then i have thoroughly enjoyed his performances (brief as they may be) in pulp fiction, true romance, and annie hall ("can i confess something? i tell you this as an artist, i think you'll understand." he then goes on to describe a dream of his own fiery death in a car wreck). i'm not a big fan of willem dafoe. he looks too much like mick jagger on a really bad day. i have only seen him in platoon and clear and present danger, but his affiliation with dreck like speed 2 and body of evidence keeps me from thinking of him as a good actor. as the producer's name flashed through the credits, it rang a bell. edward r. pressman has been responsible for bombs like legionnaire and street fighter, but he has produced several good movies like reversal of fortune and the crow. last but not least on the list of the movie's merits, it is based on a short story by william gibson. gibson all but invented the cyberpunk subgenre, and is also responsible for writing johnny mnemonic. so, what went wrong? simple: not enough attention to the plot, to characterization, to anything that makes a movie compelling and interesting other than naked flesh. this is otherwise known as the fine line between cinema and porn. it's no wonder it only screened at an obscure film festival. what's the dvd like? i'll list the positives here, but save the negatives for the rebuttal witness. for a release from a small label, there is a considerable array of extras. the menus are nicely designed and intuitive. the scene access menu has a film clip for each of the 24 chapters. screenwriter christ zois supplies a commentary track. biographies are provided for the lead actors, the supporting actors, the director, the screenwriter, and william gibson. it's nice to see that if a studio is going to provide bios, they do it for more that two people (are you listening, warner brothers?). a ten-picture photo gallery, a trivia game, the theatrical trailer, and the trailers for seven other sterling home entertainment dvd releases round out the extras. i debated for some time if i should write a review of new rose hotel. if i was going to write a review, i could not be anything less than truthful about the quality of the movie or of the disc. sterling is a small company, and the movies they release do not receive much press. call it sympathy, call it rooting for the underdog, but i didn't want to contribute negative press to sully their small reputation. besides, who was going to be looking for a review anyway? the movie made a paltry $20,416 at the u.s. box office. the internet movie database listed only three other reviews. the only positive thing that could be said was that christopher walken was in it. imbd's reader's poll gave it a 4.9 with only 104 votes. here's my laundry list of complaints with the disc. the movie is presented in a 1.85:1 non-anamorphic transfer. it has surpassed the loss of sexual innocence as the worst dvd transfer i have ever seen. it was like watching my old vcr that hasn't been cleaned in two years. it was pixelated, washed out, the picture looked flat, dark scenes were excessively noisy (and just about the entire movie was dark scenes), and the print had perpetual dirt and scratches. the packaging identifies the audio tracks as dolby digital 5.1 and dolby surround 2.0. my player detected the surround track as mere stereo. only spanish subtitles are provided. i consider this a grave offense, for i quite often turn on the subtitles to catch dialogue that is muddled, like most of the conversations in new rose hotel. to quote the fifth element, "i only speak two languages: english and bad english." the panoply of extras confirms that quality is better than quantity. lastly, i felt i had been duped by the movie's packaging. imagine that you walk into your dvd retailer of choice. while you are perusing their selection, you come across a movie you haven't heard of. its black-and-blue color scheme and images of computer code and printed circuit boards make it look like something akin to the matrix. the marketing blurb promises: "welcome to a brave new world. from acclaimed writer william gibson comes an exotic cyberpunk fantasy where technology is the ultimate game and nobody plays by the rules." wow, sounds pretty exciting, huh? it concludes, "be prepared for a riveting vision of a frightening future, where global corporations control the world and high stakes industrial espionage is where the action is." there's nothing vaguely cyberpunk about new rose hotel, other than fake handheld computers with cheesy graphics. there's nothing "riveting" or "frightening" about the world the movie fails to portray. there's no sense that corporations control the world, other than by showing high-rise office buildings. there is zero action in the movie. the only action is hinted at in a taped phone conversation. what are we left with? walken and dafoe talking, and talking, and ogling naked women, then talking some more. the only thing on this disc that stuck with me ten minutes after watching the movie was the trailer for space truckers. it had a background score that sounded very, very familiar. the next day i remembered it was in the trailer for alien resurrection. there. movie forgotten. with apologies to sterling home entertainment, i cannot recommend new rose hotel to anyone for either purchase or rental. the disc and the film are sentenced to life in a turkish prison. at the mercy of the court, sterling home entertainment's sentence is commuted to one year probation under the court's stern eye.  •montana •jacked up! •the crow: collector's series •excalibur (hd dvd)  did we give new rose hotel a fair trial?

cyberpunk author, bruce bethke in spring of 1980, bruce bethke was trying to coin a term to describe the next generation of “motorcycle punks.” there wasn’t a good word to describe this coming archetype and so he “set out to create and define that word.” the core idea that inspired the term was: the kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be holy terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly “speaking computer.” the word then became the very intentional title for his short story, cyberpunk, about a group of hacker teens bucking the system, exploiting systems for personal gain, and rebelling against their parents. this is a common trope now, but when bethke wrote about it, it was a new idea. it wasn’t until july 1982, though, that bethke finally sold the story to the magazine amazing stories and it was november 1983 before the story was published. the story also popularized the vision of the teenage hacker with a mohawk, which was inspired by the visage of billy idol; who ironically would go on to adopt the cyberpunk identity with his 1993 cyberpunk album. art accompanying the short story cyberpunk in amazing stories by bob walters the word was popularized by gardner dozois in his 1984 article for the washington post, called science fiction in the eighties, to describe the new wave of science fiction writers. about the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic “school” would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been refereed to as “cyberpunks” — sterling, gibson, shiner, cadigan, bear. the name was thereafter sealed in the ink of the science fiction authors of the ’80s. bruce sterling then owned the term in the essential 1986 anthology: mirrorshades – the cyberpunk anthology. although at this point the cyberpunk aesthetic had been well established, mirrorshades was the first collection of cyberpunk works and was edited by one of the original cyberpunks, giving it additional credibility. if dozois sealed “cyberpunk” in ink, sterling etched it in stone. since the invention of the word in 1980, it has “gone on to have quite an interesting career of its own,” as bethke has said. the term cyberpunk is in the public domain, and that matters. the term cyberpunk is in the public domain, and no one has the right to trademark cyberpunkâ„¢ the comic book, or cyberpunkâ„¢ the card game, or cyberpunkâ„¢ the crappy derivative franchised ya novel series. — bruce bethke this allows the term cyberpunk to maintain its “punkness.” billy idol pushed it with his album cyberpunk, the roleplaying game cyberpunk 2013/2020 added the year so r. talisorian inc. could trademark the name, but we all get to use the term. this has allowed for a culture to rise around the word. literature, movies, television, comics, music, these are all things that define a culture. because bethke didn’t trademark the word, it is our word. an open source term that can continue to evolve as the culture evolves. cyberpunk will never die, because it can change. as long as humanity isn’t perfect, as long as there are haves and have-nots, and as long technology is integral part of who we are, cyberpunk will persist. the cyberpunks are here, and we aren’t going anywhere. in 1989, bethke sold a completed novel based on the original short story, but it was never published due to conflict over the ending. bethke has made the novel available for free on his website. or you can read the original short story here. you can read bethke’s full essay on “the etymology of “cyberpunk,” on his website. you can find bethke’s published cyberpunk novel, headcrash, here. some of the links included in this article are amazon affiliate links. if you would like to purchase these items, consider using the links provided and help support neon dystopia.   stephen anderson   november 13, 2016, 2:59 pm  interesting, i didn’t know some of the history of cyberpunk.   i think you did miss one very early but very important mile stone book…  john brenner’s shockwave rider (1975). https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_shockwave_rider   isaac l. wheeler (veritas)   november 13, 2016, 9:39 pm  shockwave rider is referenced by bethke as part of the inspiration for his short story, cyberpunk. i considered including this part, but decided it was more relevant to a discussion about proto-cyberpunk than the origin of the word. thanks for pointing it out though!   stephen anderson   november 13, 2016, 3:01 pm  sigh… “brunner”… do you think the cyberdeck 7 had annoying autocorrect?   ğÿ™‚   bryan rumble   november 15, 2016, 6:30 pm  i do find it interesting that brunner’s the shockwave rider, published in 1975, is considered by genre historians to be proto-cyberpunk while gibson’s fragments of a hologram rose, published in 1977, is considered to be the first cyberpunk story.  it’s not exactly clear what the missing components were that keeps the shockwave rider and similar works being deemed proto- instead of canon cyberpunk, but the time to transition from proto- to the fully realized sub-genre is a lot narrower than many would think.  however, the ideas had been around for decades, perhaps as long ago as 1953 with bester’s the demolished man.   isaac l. wheeler (veritas)   november 16, 2016, 12:25 am  i agree, the roots to cyberpunk reach back pretty far. i think that gibson is seen by many as the creator of cyberpunk and therefore anything written by him is cyberpunk by default. there really isn’t a specific instance when things become cyberpunk, so it could be argued that the shockwave rider is, in fact, cyberpunk. i see the emergence of cyberpunk as more of a gradient of events rather than a moment in time. as we approach neuromancer, we see more and more cyberpunk like work, then the 80s and early 90s are full of it, then as interest wanes and post-cyberpunk becomes less focused on the punk elements we see a dip. i think the current part of the gradient is moving back towards purer cyberpunk.   bruce   november 21, 2016, 3:32 am  definitely, neuromancer is the book that had every editor, agent, and publisher in the business saying, “damn, i got to get in on that action!” that’s one of the things that makes it really hard to discuss literary history. writing is a craft, that sometimes rises to being an art, but publishing is a *business*. so there’s what writers are actually thinking about and doing, and then there’s what magazine editors are buying and publishing, and then there’s what book publishers are buying and publishing, and then there’s what editors and agents are looking for, and there’s always about a two-year time smear between each step in this chain. (editors and agents are *always* looking for a book exactly like last year’s big bestseller, “only different.”) so what happened by the late 1980s/early 1990s is that every agent, editor, and publisher in the business was saying, “cyberpunk is hot. we need to get us some.” and by that point there were a lot of people who’d learned how to *fake* the cyberpunk style well enough to sell it editors and publishers, who, let’s be honest, as a class, are people who have trouble knowing which end of a hot soldering iron to hold, and the result was what the result always is. in short order, the market got saturated with imitation neuromancer novels that copped the look and feel but didn’t have anything *new* to say, and the readers got bored and moved on to something else.   bruce   november 20, 2016, 1:57 am  why is the shockwave rider considered proto-cyberpunk and not true cyberpunk? beats me. you may as well ask why twain’s _a connecticut yankee in king arthur’s court_ is considered a burlesque of a romantic chivalry novel and not science fiction.   bruce not sterling   november 18, 2016, 5:00 am  thanks for kind words, isaac!

(weird historical factoid: john brunner was a friend, and i was drinking with him the night he died. this thought still creeps me out a little.) to a lesser extent john sladek’s novels, the muller-fokker effect and mechasm. (sladek was also a very good friend, and i still miss him.) yes, bester’s the demolished man, though if you want to get picky that could be dated back to 1951, as that’s when it was serialized in galaxy. i was also going through a philip k. dick phase at the time, though i can’t point to any obvious bits that i lifted from pkd. but the two books that really contributed most strongly to my sense of what the techno future would be like were the godwhale, by t.j. bass (good luck finding a copy of it now), and a specter is haunting texas, by fritz leiber, which i first read when it was serialized in galaxy in 1968. of course, the one i read later, that had me saying, “damn, i wish i’d written that!” was “true names,” by vernor vinge.   isaac l. wheeler (veritas)   november 20, 2016, 2:11 am  thank you for sharing the anecdotes, and that is one hell of a weird historical factoid. also, true names is an excellent novella that i really should also write about.   bruce   november 20, 2016, 2:04 am  of course, those are just the traceable, citable influences. a lot of the deep concept probably evolved from all those late-night bull sessions with two of my oldest and best friends (and former roommates), dr. john [name redacted], whose a.i. software is still crawling around inside rovers on mars, and dr. charles [name redacted]. recently retired after a long and successful career spent designing “smart” weapons and blowing shit up. pingback: when neuromancer came out in 1984 the word “cyberpunk” had not yet come to be associated with a new literary movement. the gears of the cyberpunk movement began to turn with early cyberpunk novels like transmanicon (1979) and city come a-walkin’ (1980) from john shirley, the artificial kid (1980) by bruce sterling, and a slew of short fiction from the likes of gibson, shirley, sterling, pat cadigan, and many more. and it wasn’t just a literary movement; movies like escape from new york (1981), alien (1979), and blade runner (1982) began to solidify the visual aesthetic. neuromancer, though, was the moment everyone noticed that this was a pattern. the tropes had all come together. in 1986, well after cyberpunk was the accepted word to describe this new science fiction movement, norman spinrad suggested that the real word we should be using to describe cyberpunk was “neuromantics” because people were mostly copying neuromancer. this is a short sighted diagnosis, but there is a modicum of validity; so why did we choose cyberpunk?

filed under: cyberpunk 2077 suffers from the same xenophobic tropes as its predecessors “wake the fuck up, samurai,” johnny silverhand growls, crouching over player character v in a dump somewhere around the outskirts of night city. “we have a city to burn.” behind him floats an advertisement for kiroshi opticals; a neon purple eye on a holographic display peers out to an area out of focus. early marketing material for cyberpunk 2077 cemented this line into popular consciousness, and specifically the use of samurai in context to the game. it has been used in nearly everything since. even in the 2018 trailer for cyberpunk 2077, you could see the word “samurai” emblazoned on the back of v’s collar, just above a heavily stylized image of an oni’s face. at gamescom and e3 2019, press members received jackets showing the oni’s face as well, bringing the orientalist fantasy into our own reality. it’s cool. it’s slick. it’s cyberpunk. the idea and the iconography of the samurai in the western consciousness has been diluted into two things — the venerable samurai of akira kurosawa films, or the highly stylized, slick street samurai that occupies the neon-illuminated cities of cyberpunk media. yet within the cyberpunk genre, japanese corporations are the enemy, even as multi-national vocabularies and cultures have been congealed together to create a future envisioned by paranoia and fear. this is one of the many examples of techno-orientalism and xenophobia that has been persistent since cyberpunk’s inception. the world of cyberpunk 2077 oozes the patchwork aesthetic of 1980s orientalism, and the subconscious fear of an america that is no longer american but instead dominated by japanese ultra-capitalism. you roll out of bed to radio programs making jabs at japanese whale fishing; the streets of kabuki and japantown are densely packed with a hodgepodge of chinese and japanese-inspired buildings and street vendors; and the arasaka corporation reigns supreme — mostly uncontested by rival military groups. that is also where the crux of cyberpunk 2077’s story lies: in the ineffective dismantling of a japanese corporation that functions as a shadow organization, pulling the strings behind major world events. naturally, other organizations exist within the multicultural night city, but arasaka remains the most prominent with the game; the corporation has even developed an item that is effectively the in-universe equivalent to the philosopher’s stone. the arasaka corporation is a “modern” reimagining of the japanese zaibatsu from the 1930s to late 1940s, with arasaka effectively representing one or even all of the “big four” conglomerates that existed under and during imperial japanese rule. ceo and founder of the corporation, saburo arasaka, is a stand-in for the ultra-nationalist japanese soldier turned savvy businessman. while the game, and the original cyberpunk tabletop games that inspired it, could have provided players an avenue to actually push back against a pro-imperialist ultra-capitalist society, that isn’t the path 2077 wants to go down. instead, it allows you to be a rebel and to dismantle the corporation under specific terms and conditions, while trying to balance the idea of “cool japan” simultaneously. cyberpunk as a genre has a long history with exotifying asian cultures and countries — specifically japan in regard to its text and hong kong concerning its aesthetic. cyberpunk arose to prominence during the 1980s through formative works like william gibson’s neuromancer, which envisioned the future as a techno-dystopia. the genre further cemented itself when ridley scott’s blade runner became a cult classic. that film has gone on to inspire decades of cyberpunk media, including the tabletop game that cyberpunk 2077 draws direct inspiration from; at this point, blade runner is perhaps more widely known than gibson’s neuromancer or the book that inspired it, phillip k. dick’s do androids dream of electric sheep? while neuromancer toyed with the idea of a technology-ridden dystopia, blade runner fully envisioned it. the movie also expanded on and pulled from themes in dick’s science fiction, such as the fear of america no longer seated in the position of a world power; before androids, dick had published the man in high castle, in which the axis powers won world war ii. the foundations were already set for cyberpunk to slot itself into the territory of dystopian alternate fiction with america’s eyes on east asian corporations as the newly envisioned threat. the sets of blade runner are visual examples of the economic fear of the 1980s, and specifically the fear of an america that has become more japanese than american. holographic geisha advertise products while main character rick deckard eats ramen, as opposed to a more traditionally american fast food like hamburgers. in chi hyun park’s orientalism in u.s. cyberpunk cinema, the author notes that ridley scott envisioned this future as “distinctly asian, highly technological,” which contributes to the techno-orientalist landscape and aesthetic that is entrenched in the film and within the genre. even in the opening shot of the city, you see los angeles mostly populated with east asian people, and while the city itself does have a large japanese population in real life, this visual also cements what american corporations were afraid of at the time. in the 1980s, japan was in its “bubble period,” with the country’s economy growing substantially due to post-war government policies that included the development of technology. this was also partially due to the u.s.-japanese alliance that was formed shortly after world war ii. maximizing u.s. interests in science and technology relations in japan, a text that details technological and economical advancements in japan post-world war ii, mentions that “a unifying thread in japan’s postwar industrial success stories has been the effective utilization and improvement of technology acquired from abroad,” this not being strictly limited to the literal application of technology, but also innovation in areas such as “management and systems techniques.” this allowed japan to gain a foothold in the global economy and earn a place as a rising world power. however, once the bubble period “popped” and the japanese economy began to deflate, xenophobia toward japan and by extension japanese people began to redirect itself.  this made way for the “cool japan” phenomenon, which was bolstered by the japanese government in the mid-2000s and helped recreate how the west effectively saw japan. in the ’80s, the west had viewed japan as a threat to america’s economic status as a world power, and cyberpunk as a genre reflected that fear. but through soft marketing bolstered by the general interest of japanese pop culture in the early to mid-2000s, japan was able to recreate a more palatable image through manga, anime, music, and other avenues to effectively change the way the country had otherwise been perceived. cyberpunk stories incorporated “cool japan” into the existing history of the genre; all of it intertwined in the diluted replications of the genre that were to follow. what represented xenophobic anxieties of a technology-controlled future wrested out of the hands of white america turned into the orientalist reproduction of the aesthetic. cyberpunk 2077 proves to be a modern incarnation of the genre’s historic faults and problems regarding its portrayal of japanese and other east asian people. 2077 seeks to fulfill those fantasies, as it lapses into the “cool japan’’ category with its akira easter eggs, katanas, and even calling the player “samurai,” adopting what western media has heavily associated with the trajectory of coolness in japanese media, be it cyberpunk or feudal. and while the most recent tabletop scenario book skirts around the now mostly defunct arasaka corporation and all of the baggage it effectively carries, we see the same techno-orientalism and xenophobia shift its focus toward chinese corporations — which now reflects modern america’s anxieties toward mainland china. but it doesn’t have to be this way. there are pieces of modern cyberpunk media that use the tropes of the genre, and the fears associated with those tropes, to great success and without falling into orientalism or the xenophobia that accompanies it. love shore, currently in development by perfect garbage studios, and the recently released umurangi generation by origame digital, both center narratives around marginalized people in techno-dystopias without falling into orientalism. katana zero by askiisoft uses the “cool japan’’ trope and techno-orientalist street samurai iconography but flips these tropes on their head in a staggeringly effective way. cyberpunk stories can be told effectively without supplanting the fear of the “other” while simultaneously aping culture for the sake of aesthetics. we can have stories about fighting back against ultra-capitalist corporations and authoritarian dictatorships that step away from the tropes that have continued to drag the genre down. it’s what we deserve, and what stories about our future — as bleak as it may be — should be about. filed under: cyberpunk 2077 suffers from the same xenophobic tropes as its predecessors “wake the fuck up, samurai,” johnny silverhand growls, crouching over player character v in a dump somewhere around the outskirts of night city. “we have a city to burn.” behind him floats an advertisement for kiroshi opticals; a neon purple eye on a holographic display peers out to an area out of focus. early marketing material for cyberpunk 2077 cemented this line into popular consciousness, and specifically the use of samurai in context to the game. it has been used in nearly everything since. even in the 2018 trailer for cyberpunk 2077, you could see the word “samurai” emblazoned on the back of v’s collar, just above a heavily stylized image of an oni’s face. at gamescom and e3 2019, press members received jackets showing the oni’s face as well, bringing the orientalist fantasy into our own reality. it’s cool. it’s slick. it’s cyberpunk. the idea and the iconography of the samurai in the western consciousness has been diluted into two things — the venerable samurai of akira kurosawa films, or the highly stylized, slick street samurai that occupies the neon-illuminated cities of cyberpunk media. yet within the cyberpunk genre, japanese corporations are the enemy, even as multi-national vocabularies and cultures have been congealed together to create a future envisioned by paranoia and fear. this is one of the many examples of techno-orientalism and xenophobia that has been persistent since cyberpunk’s inception. the world of cyberpunk 2077 oozes the patchwork aesthetic of 1980s orientalism, and the subconscious fear of an america that is no longer american but instead dominated by japanese ultra-capitalism. you roll out of bed to radio programs making jabs at japanese whale fishing; the streets of kabuki and japantown are densely packed with a hodgepodge of chinese and japanese-inspired buildings and street vendors; and the arasaka corporation reigns supreme — mostly uncontested by rival military groups. that is also where the crux of cyberpunk 2077’s story lies: in the ineffective dismantling of a japanese corporation that functions as a shadow organization, pulling the strings behind major world events. naturally, other organizations exist within the multicultural night city, but arasaka remains the most prominent with the game; the corporation has even developed an item that is effectively the in-universe equivalent to the philosopher’s stone. the arasaka corporation is a “modern” reimagining of the japanese zaibatsu from the 1930s to late 1940s, with arasaka effectively representing one or even all of the “big four” conglomerates that existed under and during imperial japanese rule. ceo and founder of the corporation, saburo arasaka, is a stand-in for the ultra-nationalist japanese soldier turned savvy businessman. while the game, and the original cyberpunk tabletop games that inspired it, could have provided players an avenue to actually push back against a pro-imperialist ultra-capitalist society, that isn’t the path 2077 wants to go down. instead, it allows you to be a rebel and to dismantle the corporation under specific terms and conditions, while trying to balance the idea of “cool japan” simultaneously. cyberpunk as a genre has a long history with exotifying asian cultures and countries — specifically japan in regard to its text and hong kong concerning its aesthetic. cyberpunk arose to prominence during the 1980s through formative works like william gibson’s neuromancer, which envisioned the future as a techno-dystopia. the genre further cemented itself when ridley scott’s blade runner became a cult classic. that film has gone on to inspire decades of cyberpunk media, including the tabletop game that cyberpunk 2077 draws direct inspiration from;

she’s missing the bottom half of her face, a gaping cybernetic maw in its place. a cable jacked directly into a businessman’s skull, sparking and smoking as it fries his brain. an elevator the size of an apartment, crawling up the side of a high-rise towards the sky.  these are just some of the fragmented vignettes studio cd projekt red put on display in cyberpunk 2077’s debut trailer in 2018. as an introduction to night city, it promised one of the most distinctive game settings since rapture or city 17 — but not much of its neon-soaked imagery is original. and that’s by design. with this game, cd projekt red is drawing from a long tradition, one that — unusually — is named right there in the title: cyberpunk. but what exactly does that mean, and where did it come from? you can trace the roots of cyberpunk back through multiple generations, but the first definite milestone in its development was the book do androids dream of electric sheep? philip k. dick’s 1968 novel introduced the world to rick deckard, a bounty hunter tracking down a gang of escaped androids trying to pass as humans. if that sounds familiar, it’s because the book was adapted, over a decade later, into blade runner.  the movie’s night-drenched cityscape, lit by plumes of flame from industrial towers and skyscraping video billboards, set the visual template for most cyberpunk going forward. but that world didn’t come from dick’s novel as much as it did the long tomorrow, a 1975 comic by french artist moebius and screenwriter dan o’bannon. moebius’ conception of a grimy future city, where tightly-crammed tower blocks form a deep chasm around its inhabitants, inspired not only director ridley scott, but also katsuhiro otomo — whose akira manga began publication in japan in 1982, the same year as blade runner’s release — and an american-canadian novelist named william gibson. but we’ll get back to him. between do androids dream of electric sheep?’s questions about who counts as human in an age of androids, the long tomorrow’s blending of film-noir tropes and science fiction, and blade runner’s rain-slick realization of the city of the future, all the vital ingredients were in place for cyberpunk by the early 1980s. all it needed was a name. “understand, when i came up with the c-word in 1980, all i was trying to do was come up with a snappy, one-word title for this story,” says bruce bethke, the writer who first coined “cyberpunk,” referring to an article he wrote about teenage hackers. “i was not trying to define a genre, launch a movement or do anything more than come up with a memorable one-word marketing label for this story that would — i hoped — compress the core idea down to a few syllables and — this was the important part — stick in an editor’s mind and help me sell the thing to a magazine. “apparently i overdid it.” when the story published in 1983, bethke — “unintentionally and accidentally,” in his words — tapped into something larger. the title was adopted as the name of a loose genre that was beginning to form, just in time for the arrival of what many feel has been its definitive work: neuromancer, by william gibson. the 1984 novel tells the story of “console cowboy” case, a hacker who crosses his criminal bosses and, as payback, gets his central nervous system trashed so badly he can no longer access the cyberspace “matrix.” at the start of the book, he’s offered a second chance by a mysterious new employer. case can be fixed, but only if he agrees to help with a string of heists which take him from japan’s night city to the american sprawl and eventually an orbital space station, in order to free a super-advanced ai. the story blended crime and science fiction — but, like blade runner before it, what really struck a chord was the world that gibson laid out. neuromancer’s vision of the future can be divided in two. between the grubby, crime-filled meatspace and the bright glare of cyberspace. between the people on the streets struggling to survive, and the aristocrats orbiting the planet, struggling to find ways to fill their artificially-extended lifespans. between the aging remnants of our world – early in the book, case buys “a fifty-year-old vietnamese imitation of a south american copy of a walther ppk” — and cutting-edge technology that lets people augment their bodies with new limbs, eyes, skin — as long as they can afford the bill. neuromancer marked out the boundaries of the genre, boundaries which were explored and cemented by the books that followed. pat cadigan’s mindplayers and synners focused on the psychological implications of brain modification technology. rudy rucker’s ware series followed neuromancer’s thread of self-aware ai through to its logical conclusion, showing how the resulting mechanical lifeforms evolve through successive generations. bruce sterling’s work, like islands in the net, was especially interested in the hacker subculture. sterling was something of a figurehead in the cyberpunk scene, earning the nickname ‘chairman bruce.’ he edited 1986’s mirrorshades: the cyberpunk anthology, a deliberately definitive collection of short stories that included work by gibson, cadigan and rucker. in the preface to that book, sterling wrote: “certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk. the theme of body invasion: prosthetic limbs, implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. the even more powerful theme of mind invasion: brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, neurochemistry – techniques radically redefining the nature of humanity, the nature of the self.” cyberpunk meshes these advanced technologies with more down-to-earth concerns like drugs, dive bars and desperation that turn people to crime. the ruling powers of cyberpunk worlds are almost always immense corporations who control access to technology. the protagonists tend to be outsiders — criminals and noir-style antiheroes — who exist on the margins of society. there’s an oft-quoted maxim by sterling that sums it up nicely: “lowlife and high-tech.” in 1988, cyberpunk made its first move to the tabletop with the release of cyberpunk, a pen-and-paper roleplaying game written by mike pondsmith. it shares more than a name with cyberpunk 2077 – cd projekt red’s video game is a direct adaptation, moving away from a group of people sitting around a table to a first-person, open world, single-player experience but keeping its world, character classes and the input of its creator. pondsmith tells polygon how he personally defines cyberpunk as a genre: “street-level life crushed under overwhelming political and social forces, but which uses a combination of found/scavenged/repurposed technology to fight back and achieve personal freedom.” pondsmith hadn’t actually read the likes of gibson and sterling when he wrote the first iteration of cyberpunk, he says, but he started to incorporate their ideas into the rpg’s second edition, known as cyberpunk 2020.  the once-molten form of cyberpunk was beginning to cool into something more solid. and for a genre where one of the key tenets is — to quote the rulebook of cyberpunk 2020 — “break the rules,” that’s not necessarily a good thing. “what happened to cyberpunk fiction was what happens to every successful new thing in any branch of pop culture,” says bruce bethke. “it went from being something unexpected, fresh and original to being a trendy fashion statement, to being the flavor of the month, to being a repeatable commercial formula, to being a hoary trope.” the motifs of gibson’s neuromancer turned into a kind of checklist. stories of alienated loners in mirrored shades doing drugs and hacking computers quickly became the norm. so much so that in the early ‘90s, some of the most prominent cyberpunk books were those which pushed the formula to satirical extremes. the opening chapter of neal stephenson’s book snow crash introduces the improbably-named hiro protagonist, a ‘deliverator’ armed with twin samurai swords, driving a car with “enough potential energy packed into its batteries to fire a pound of bacon into the asteroid belt” — before revealing that he’s actually a pizza delivery boy.  in his 1995 novel headcrash, bethke even skewered the genre he’d helped christen, writing: “they’re total wankers and losers who indulge in messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures. you know, cyberpunks.” it looked like cyberpunk might have run its course — as early as 1993, a wired magazine headline proclaimed “cyberpunk r.i.p.” — but what followed, as the millennium raced to its conclusion, made for possibly the genre’s biggest moment in the spotlight. its influence leaked outward, and the genre mutated in a dozen different directions as it entered the mainstream.  a large part of this came via japan, as akira inspired a wave of cyberpunk-infused manga and anime, including battle angel alita, serial experiments lain, cowboy bebop and, perhaps most famously, ghost in the shell, which in turn inspired the wachowskis to make the matrix. meanwhile in games, deus ex laid the foundations that cd projekt red seems to be building on with cyberpunk 2077. and hideo kojima, who had created the cyberpunk game snatcher a decade earlier, took elements like cybernetics and artificial intelligence and applied them to the hugely successful spy game metal gear solid.  how many of the above examples are ‘true’ cyberpunk, however, is debatable. they certainly share some of the genre’s technological aesthetic (think of keanu pulling a thick cable from his spine) and dress sense (all those mirrored sunglasses), but they don’t all share the same thematic concerns.  depending on who you listen to, cyberpunk became a case of — to borrow another of the mantras from 2020’s rulebook — “style over substance.” it’s a criticism that gibson himself echoed back in june, when he tweeted, “the trailer for cyberpunk 2077 strikes me as gta skinned-over with a generic 80s retro-future, but hey, that’s just me.” ultimately, though, cyberpunk has survived beyond its ‘80s roots because its appeal runs deeper than the surface layer of leather, chrome and neon. there is a clear focus on style, but it’s born out of an understanding that the way people present themselves can tell you just as much about the culture they exist in as an expository info-dump.  “the great thing about cyberpunk is that it is recognizably our world, only in the future,” says lukas litzsinger, the game designer responsible for the 2012 revival of cyberpunk card game netrunner. cyberpunk authors like gibson and neal stephenson predicted how technology would develop, and occasionally helped shape it — their books helped popularize terms like “cyberspace, “virus” and “avatar,” and stephenson’s conception of the “metaverse” has been claimed as an influence on everything from google earth to xbox live — but this isn’t the most important thing about cyberpunk’s vision of the future. “it is a setting that is focused on the human experience, and how far we can push the limits of both technology and ourselves,” says litzsinger. the writers who laid the foundation of cyberpunk looked at the accelerating pace of change in the late 20th century, and understood that technology would forever be an inseparable part of the human experience. this is still what makes the genre stand apart from other branches of sci-fi: the way it considers the social impact of technology on everyday life.  in neuromancer, having a health-monitoring implant is just another reason you might get mugged if you step into the wrong part of town. in netrunner, body augmentation is something a corporation can force on its employees to improve performance.  “for myself, the most interesting cyberpunk focuses on what it means to be human in a world that wishes to convert you into a corporate asset,” says ashley yawns, writer at nerd-culture site timber owls. yawns was a prominent voice in the twitter discussions following cyberpunk 2077’s e3 reveal, weighing up the game’s politics and in particular its presentation of body augmentation, a key component of cyberpunk. “body modification is a great avenue for empowering stories for groups routinely denied bodily autonomy: disabled people, trans people, women as a whole, etc.,” says yawns. “the problem is that utopianism clashes with the impoverished lives cyberpunk depicts, immediately raising the question of who can afford these freedoms. “enabling bodily autonomy, alteration and restored function is a great thing but as things stand, access for the majority means debt or servitude to malicious corporate monopolies,” says yawns. “anyone who’s experienced tech industry practices of planned obsolescence and covert data collection on their phone can imagine what these companies might do given access your cybernetic limbs, let alone your whole nervous system. “liberating tech is often made into a yoke by its social context.” cyberpunk 2077 has involved months of crunch, despite past promises that last part is the biomechanically-enhanced heart of cyberpunk. william gibson has often summed it up in interviews: “the future is already here — it’s just not very evenly distributed.” cyberpunk worlds are about the gap between those who have access to their futuristic technologies and those who don’t — a gap that’s often expressed literally, in the verticality of its mega-cities.  even as the future that writers like gibson predicted starts to look increasingly out of date technologically speaking, it’s this core message which keeps the genre relevant. “i personally think that any cyberpunk work worthy of the name needs to show that dehumanizing, unequal relationship of power and politics as part of its makeup,” says pondsmith. “you don’t raise hell in a future where things are a star trekkian utopia — you raise hell when all the forces in power are arrayed against you personally, and you have to fight back.” this is an element of pondsmith’s game that cd projekt red seems to be adapting faithfully. “cyberpunk 2077 is about a world where a vanishingly small number of ultra-rich individuals at the top of intractable corporate power structures reign over a disintegrating world where the vast majority of the population lives in an endless cycle of poverty and violence,” quest designer patrick mills told official xbox magazine. “how different that is from our world depends a lot on your perspective, i suppose.” in a time when developers and publishers are insisting, against all evidence, that their games have no political message, it’s a stark contrast to see mills saying: “cyberpunk is an inherently political genre and it’s an inherently political franchise.” litzsinger agrees: “to me, cyberpunk does feel inherently political in that its protagonists almost always operate on the fringes of the law, whether because of criminal activity or the inability for the law to keep up with technology. it can challenge us to think about the difference between something that is legal and something that is moral, and you will find a common thread of rebellion against ‘the system’ in a lot of cyberpunk narratives.” litzsinger’s netrunner — which is ending later this year — is one of the most politically aware incarnations of cyberpunk ever to exist. that might be surprising, given it’s a card game, but the theming and flavor text of netrunner’s thousand-plus cards have given it plenty of room to flesh out its setting and worldview. whereas many cyberpunk works have stuck to the narrow focus on u.s., japan and china that was established in neuromancer, the world of netrunner has covered ... well, the entire world. it’s made ecuador the global centre of commerce, and has dedicated entire ‘cycles’ of card packs to exploring india and sub-saharan africa. its roster of playable characters has retained a 50:50 balance between male and female, as well as including non-binary and transgender characters, and put asian people in lead roles rather than just being an invisible part of the world, as in many western cyberpunk stories. representation is one area where cyberpunk 2077 has run into a bit of controversy. the game’s debut trailer featured just one indian character, in the stereotypical role of taxi driver. the twitter account of dear esther developer the chinese room accused the game’s marketing of presenting women in a sexist manner, and cd projekt red recently tweeted a transphobic joke from its own twitter account. with nearly an hour to show us its world, a 2018 gameplay demo fares a little better, especially as the player can choose v’s gender and race — but it’s far from perfect. the majority of characters players meet are white, with the exception of black crime boss dexter deshawn and sweary latino sidekick jackie welles, the latter having received criticism for stereotypical dialogue that drops random nuggets of spanish into english sentences. and, in light cd projekt red’s long-debated attitude to female nudity, opening with a quest that involves an unconscious naked woman also invites questions. broadly, though, cd projekt red seems keen to stick to pondsmith’s original vision, which addressed everything from gentrification to corporate security forces. the developer’s frame-by-frame, trailer-breakdown blogs show it’s thinking about topics like overexposure to advertising, gun laws and unevenly distributed technological wealth as part of its world building. cyberpunk, and science fiction in general, can take ideas from the grey of modern life and turn up the contrast. the for-profit medicine system becomes 2077’s

to garner international attention in the late 1980s. the world of live-action japanese cyberpunk is a twisted and strange one indeed; a far cry from the established notions of computer hackers, ubiquitous technologies and domineering conglomerates as found in the pages of william gibson's neuromancer (1984) - a pivotal cyberpunk text during the sub-genre's formation and recognition in the early eighties. from a cinematic standpoint, it perhaps owes more to the industrial gothic of david lynch's eraserhead (1976) and the psycho-sexual body horror of early david cronenberg than the rain-soaked metropolis of ridley scott's blade runner (1982), although scott's neon infused tech-noir has been a major aesthetic touchstone for cyberpunk manga and anime institutions such as katsuhiro otomo's akira (1982-90) and masamune shirow's ghost in the shell (1989- ). in the western world, cyberpunk was born out of the new wave science fiction literature of the sixties and seventies; authors such harlan ellison, j.g. ballard and philip k. dick - whose novel do androids dream of electric sheep? (1968) was the basis for blade runner - were key proponents in its inception, creating worlds that featured artificial life, social decay and technological dependency. the hard-boiled detective novels of dashiell hammett also proved influential with regards to the sub-genre's overall pessimistic stance. what came to be known as cyberpunk by the mid 1980s was thematically characterised by its exploration of the impact of high-technology on low-lives - people living in squalor; stacked on top of one another within an oppressive metropolis dominated by advanced technologies. live-action, japanese cyberpunk on the other hand, is raw and primal by nature, and characterised by attitude rather than high-concept. a collision between flesh and metal, the sub-genre is an explosion of sex, violence, concrete and machinery; a small collection of pocket-sized universes that revel in post-human nightmares and teratological fetishes, powered by a boundaryless sense of invasiveness and violation. imagery is abject, perverse and unpredictable and, like cronenberg's work, bodily mutation through technological intervention is a major theme, as are dehumanisation, repression and sexuality. during the late eighties and early nineties, it was a sub-strain characterised largely by the early work of two directors; shinya tsukamoto and shozin fukui. these directors made films that were short, sharp, bludgeoning and centred on corporeal horrors that saw the body invaded, infected and infused with technology. tsukamoto's contributions are perhaps the most famous; tetsuo: the iron man (1989) and tetsuo ii: the body hammer (1992). both films present the nightmarish situation of their protagonists (played by actor tomorowo taguchi in both) undergoing a bizarre metamorphosis that sees a humble salaryman turn from a human into a hybrid of flesh and scrap metal. although not as well known to western audiences, fukui's work is also important. stylistically similar to tsukamoto but sufficiently divergent so as not to be a mere copy, fukui opened up the sub-genre's pallet by incorporating cronenberg like scientific experiments that impact on the body through technological augmentation as evidenced in his contributions pinocchio v946 (1991) and rubber's lover (1996). these films focus on the venerability of the human mind and how such alteration can cause more than a physical change in appearance, but create a completely new mental state and thought processes that are beyond human. tsukamoto and fukui eschewed many of conventions crystallised by gibson's archetypal neuromancer. there are no mega-conglomerates or incidences of virtual reality and the power struggle between high-technology versus low-quality of life is replaced by low-technology versus low-life. the technology in their vision of cyberpunk consisted of industrial scrap - tetsuo - and makeshift laboratories built from crude and dated equipment - rubber's lover - lending a diy aesthetic to their overall ethos. these were, after all, films made with little or no money and as a result, were not set in gargantuan, near-future metropolises but the present-day, real-life cyberpunk city of tokyo, suggesting that anxieties over rapid modernity are not some far-off venture but something that should be worried about now. both filmmakers also had a fixation with post-industrial landscapes; using scrap yards, boiler rooms, abandoned warehouses, compounds and factories as decaying playgrounds for their ideas. however, this new and defiant take on the sub-genre did not come about overnight. there are many precursors to both tsukamoto and fukui's work that also need to be addressed. some are quite well known to western audiences whilst others have yet to get the recognition that they deserve in helping to create one of the most fascinating and philosophical phases in contemporary japanese cinema. whilst the ideas of cyberpunk in the west were born out of literature, japanese cyberpunk, it could be argued, was born out of music. during the late seventies and early eighties, tokyo was enjoying an incredibly vibrant underground punk music scene. an ethos that later branched out into art and cinema thanks largely to one individual: sogo ishii. born in 1957, ishii quickly built a reputation of being somewhat of a maverick and grew to be a prominent figure of the tokyo underground filmmaking scene. operating within the gathering rubble of a collapsing studio system, ishii turned out a variety of zero-budget 8mm film projects at a time when former international filmmaking heavyweights such as akira kurosawa were struggling to find financial investment.  early feature film efforts such as panic high school (1978) and crazy thunder road (1980) encapsulated the rebellion and anarchy associated with punk and went on to become highly influential in underground film circles. crazy thunder road in particular pointed the way forward with its biker-gang punk aesthetic; a style that would be explored later in otomo's highly influential akira. originally made as a university graduation project, it was picked up for distribution by major studio toei, making ishii the first of his generation to move from amateur filmmaking into the professional industry while still a university student [ 1 ]. after crazy thunder road, ishii made the frenetic short film shuffle (1981) - interestingly, an unofficial adaptation of a katsuhiro otomo comic strip - as well as a slew of music and concert videos for a variety of japanese punk bands. however, toei soon returned, offering ishii studio backing for his next feature film project. this new financial investment resulted in ishii's most influential work to date; burst city (1982), a film that encapsulated and epitomised his favourite subject matter: the punk movement. from punk to cyberpunk: burst city, death powder and akira no other film captured the intensity, pessimism, delinquency and the do-it-yourself bravado of japan's punk movement like ishii's burst city; a bold, brash and anarchic time-capsule of early eighties zeitgeist. however, despite its overwhelming influence - not only did it shape the conventions of japanese cyberpunk, but the future of contemporary japanese cinema as a whole - burst city remains largely unappreciated. it is frequently overshadowed by its higher profile, more internationally renowned followers: tsukamoto, takashi miike and takeshi kitano among others, all of whom are indebted to ishii's work in some shape or form. however, ishii has always played the rebel: attending his filmmaking class at nihon university only when he needed to borrow more equipment; dropping off the filmmaking radar for long stretches of time; making films of a commercially unviable length such as the 55-minute electric dragon 80,000v (2001) and challenging conventional moviegoers with his early punk films only then to defy the fans of that work with calm, hypnotic efforts such as august in the water (1995) and labyrinth of dreams (1997). it is this ethos that drives burst city; steering it through the deserted tokyo highways and barren industrial wastelands that make up its initial exposition and into the anarchic meltdown of its closing act. the visual aesthetic of burst city is an eclectic mix of punk, industrialisation and post-apocalyptic wasteland imagery reminiscent of the first two mad max films (1979  1981), with some science fiction trimmings; the futuristic cannons used by the battle police to disperse riots for instance. however, burst city acts beyond the usual genre trappings. it has the immediacy and atmosphere of a documentary, chronicling both the people and the music, whilst using the surrounding dystopian backdrop as a metaphor for the anxiety, haplessness and alienation as experienced by japan's youth at the time. this documentary feel is further enhanced by ishii's groundbreaking use of camera. his highly dynamic, handheld, almost stream-of-consciousness style shots interwoven with equally aggressive, machinegun editing not only captures the energy and restlessness of the music - which is very prominent here - but would highly influence tsukamoto and the execution of his work. the film's industrialised environments - the abandoned warehouses and run-down boiler rooms where the biker gangs and punk bands reside - would become a key aspect for the japanese cyberpunk look as well as depicting tokyo as little more than a concrete slum. the notion of the metropolis as oppressive entity starts to become apparent here and it's interesting to note that this film was made in the same year as blade runner, which again, displays similar connotations [ 2 ]. ishii's prior involvement with the punk movement allowed him to gather an impressive ensemble of real-life japanese punk bands - the rockers, the roosters and the stalin among others - as part of the cast, as well as 1970s folk singer/songwriter shigeru izumiya. interestingly, izumiya was also credited as a planner and the film's art director, suggesting that he had a strong involvement in shaping burst city's influential aesthetic. this serves as a vital link as izumiya would go on to write and direct his own film; a film that would go on to crystallise many of the conventions and ideas of japanese cyberpunk that would later be explored by tsukamoto and fukui. shigeru izumiya's death powder (1986) introduces the unorthodox visuals and abstract delivery that would prove instrumental in future japanese cyberpunk execution. like burst city, sound also plays a vital part here; further laying the foundations for the sensory assault aspect of the movement that would later be championed and refined by tsukamoto. izumiya, like ishii, is from a musical background; a popular folk singer/songwriter as well as a film composer - he wrote the music for ishii's breakthrough feature crazy thunder road. lost in public domain purgatory for decades, death powder barely exists, available on bootleg dvd and only recently as video segments on the internet [ 3 ]. western understanding of the film has been largely incoherent and underwhelming due to bad and partial translation into english and as a result, death powder is frequently overlooked. however, its influence is unmistakably clear and it's arguably the first film of japan's extreme cyberpunk movement, exemplifying the invasive, corporeal surrealism that would follow over the next ten years. set in present or near-future tokyo, the film follows a group of researchers who have in their possession guernica; a feminine, cybernetic android capable of spewing poisonous dust from its mouth. karima (played by izumiya) is left to guard the android but appears to lose his mind, attacking the other two - noris and kiyoshi - when they return. kiyoshi inhales some of guernica's powder and starts to mutate as a result. he also starts hallucinating as their subconscious starts to merge. one sequence entitled dr. loo made me - which suggests that the android is trying to communicate with kiyoshi - sees the guernica project in its early stages featuring the three researchers as well as the eccentric dr. loo, the guitar wielding head of the operation. the hallucinations provide kiyoshi with further omniscience, detailing karima's apparent love for guernica as well as the research group's ongoing struggle with the 'scar people'; men disfigured as their flesh deteriorates uncontrollably. the subject of flesh, the boundary between life and death and the notion of what it means to be human come into play regularly as the film drifts from one surrealist situation to another. death powder poses the question: if you cease to have flesh, do you cease to be human? this is an idea that is routinely explored in cyberpunk but while western examples such as blade runner and neuromancer focus on larger-scale implications, death powder - and most of japan's subsequent cyberpunk output for that matter - looks at the changes within the individual. with the former; invasive technologies are not only fully realised, but have been successfully integrated into society, thus becoming common practice. the technologies explored in the latter however, are still in their primordial stages; they are works in progress and extremely esoteric, and as a result, extremely volatile and unpredictable. death powder also establishes japanese cyberpunk's tendency to place imagery ahead of its narrative, a fundamental aspect of the no-holds barred sensory assault style that they exhibit. as a result, story and purpose are evinced from what is seen as opposed to what is told, allowing subsequent films a tonal and philosophical quality. like many similar spirited films that would follow, death powder highlights the destructive and dehumanising nature of technology. a big clue comes in the form of the android guernica sharing the same name as pablo picasso's famous 1937 painting that depicts the bombing of guernica by nazi warplanes (in support of franco) during the spanish civil war. picasso's mural shows an orgy of twisted bodies, animals and buildings, deformed by war, or more broadly, the deviant technologies that power it. the film's end sees the cast fused and writhing in an ocean of monstrous flesh; the human form consumed and destroyed at the hands of intervening science. despite death powder's aesthetic and thematic influence, it went by with little fanfare and was never seen outside of japan until years later. the subsequent, similar minded android of notre dame (kuramoto; 1988) fared slightly better, partly due to the infamy that surrounded the film series it was part of, a seven-film collection known as the guinea pig series; short exploitation features that focused on torture, murder and other destructive processes, designed to appear realistic and snuff-like [ 4 ]. android of notre dame failed to strike a chord with wider audiences and has since wallowed in cult obscurity along with its filmic brethren. however, this all changed as japanese cyberpunk began to creep into the international spotlight with the anime feature film adaptation of katsuhiro otomo's popular manga series, akira (1988). although this writing focuses mainly on live-action cyberpunk output, akira's arrival was so important and influential to the sub-genre that it needs to be acknowledged. akira achieved two things: first; it opened up and, almost single-handedly, popularised anime and manga for global audiences (especially in the uk and us) and second; it perpetuated the cyberpunk ethos on perhaps the largest scale to date - combining the neon-lit, high-technology/low-living metropolis of blade runner and neuromancer with body horror overtones. the film condensed the vast narrative of otomo's gargantuan, six-part magnum opus into a streamlined, two-hour feature directed by otomo himself. it is a milestone within japanese cyberpunk as it was the first of the sub-genre to not only have commercial success domestically, but also managed to find an audience overseas. set within the destitute overcrowding of futuristic neo tokyo, the story revolves around juvenile biker thugs and best friends kaneda and tetsuo. during a turf spat with a rival gang, tetsuo crashes but is mysteriously taken away by military and scientific officials. they experiment on him with chemically altering drugs, turning tetsuo into a psycho-kinetic demigod with uncontrollable power. he goes on a destructive rampage through the city to seek an audience with akira, a highly powerful entity that destroyed the old tokyo decades before. part of akira's success inevitably lies in its attention to detail and vaulting ambition. the budget was astronomical for an anime feature at the time - around 1,100,000,000 [ 5 ] - acquired through the partnership of several major japanese media companies including toho and bandai. it avoided the corner cutting of anime projects in the past, producing hundreds of thousands of animation cells to create fluid motion - particularly in its many action set-pieces - and capture nuances that would've otherwise not existed. otomo also went to the trouble of doing lip-synched sound recording; a first for anime, resulting in extremely high and rich production values. the film set box office records for an anime in japan during its summer 1988 release, grossing over 6,300,000,000 [ 6 ]. internationally, it got a limited theatrical run in america and the united kingdom soon after - sowing the seeds for the immense western cult fanbase that it enjoys to this day - but failed to get home video distribution until the early nineties. themes of mutation, modernity and social unrest are rife. kaneda and tetsuo's biker gang are like a revved up version of the delinquents seen in ishii's crazy thunder road and burst city, while tetsuo's esp and subsequent transformation sets the film firmly in cronenberg's body horror territory. his eventual fusion with metal - resulting in a horrific man-machine hybrid that sees tetsuo become the master of a newly formed universe - not only is evocative of the cyberpunk notion of technology corrupting the human form (in this case literally) but also serves as an important visual precursor to the movement's next breakthrough, live-action work. metal-morphosis: tetsuo: the iron man and tetsuo ii: the body hammer often revered as the definitive example of extreme japanese cyberpunk and a vital cornerstone in the rebuilding of contemporary japanese cinema, tetsuo: the iron man was a baffling international success story, prompting many a sceptic on japan's future cinematic involvement to turn their attention eastward. barely over an hour in length, tetsuo was a breath of fresh air; a no-holds-barred sensory assault that gave japanese cinema a major image renovation and launched the career of its director, shinya tsukamoto, who has gone on to become one of the country's most respected and treasured auteurs. during its unprecedented and lengthy tour of international film festivals, tetsuo not only pointed towards exciting new possibilities for contemporary japanese cinema but was able to fit 'snugly into a pantheon of genre works that included ridley scott's blade runner, james cameron's the terminator, david lynch's eraserhead and the work of david cronenberg, sam raimi and clive barker'[ 7 ], which no doubt broadened its appeal. its use of kinetic cinematography, rapid-fire editing and diy, zero-budget special effects served as an invitation; a call to arms if you will, for independent filmmakers everywhere to produce unique and challenging cinema. however, the majority of the film's innovative style is, for the most part, lifted from elsewhere, promoting the fusion of a variety of influences including the hyperactive camerawork of ishii's burst city; the body horror of cronenberg's videodrome (1983) and the fly (1986); the biomechanical perversions of artist h.r. giger; the literature of j.g. ballard - particularly crash (1973) - and the stop-motion animation of jan svankmayer. there is also a sense of strange nostalgia for the old kaiju (monster) movies and television serials that tsukamoto watched when growing up in a tokyo experiencing post-war re-construction as well as major expansion and modernising in preparation for the japan hosting of the 1964 olympic games. like ishii, tsukamoto's early development stemmed from making 8mm films as a teenager during the 1970s, using his younger brother and friends as cast and crew members. as he reached adulthood, tsukamoto abandoned filmmaking and turned his attention increasingly towards the stage, forming a theatre troupe with like minded university students and directing plays [ 8 ]. one of the plays that tsukamoto wrote would subsequently be adapted into a film; the adventure of denchu kozo (1987) with the assistance of his theatre cohorts - christened 'kaiju theatre'. it was this same group that also made tetsuo, along with a revolving-door line-up of other helpers, most notably fellow filmmaker shozin fukui who would go to make his own cyberpunk features during the nineties. tetsuo's chief concern is the impact of technology on society and subsequently - and more specifically - the human form. tsukamoto suggests that technology is a disease, bursting forth unannounced and unexplained as evidenced in the salaryman's transformation - simultaneously reminiscent of cronenberg's the fly and otomo's akira - where a shard of metal lodged in the protagonist's cheek is the starting point for further mutation. like seth brundle of the fly, the salaryman is both repulsed yet intrigued by what he is turning into and, coincidently, his evolution shares the namesake of the transforming character of akira: tetsuo; meaning 'iron man' or 'clear thinking/philosophical man'. tsukamoto embraces both interpretations of his film's title. on one hand is the literal transformation of flesh to iron and on the other, a philosophical enquiry on technology's consuming nature and the symbiosis between city and citizen. however, closer inspection reveals further concerns, as evidenced by steven t. brown, author of the groundbreaking tokyo cyberpunk: posthumanism in japanese visual culture, in which he says: 'the mixing of flesh and metal in tetsuo is not only intensely violent but also darkly erotomechanical and techno-fetishistic, evoking sadomasochistic sexual practices and pleasures, as well as fears of both male and female sexuality out of control'[ 9 ]. in this regard, tsukamoto gives horror and eroticism equal attention: the salaryman has a nightmare involving his girlfriend (played by kei fujiwara) sodomising him with a mechanical, snakelike appendage strapped to her crotch. this gender-reversal is not only representative of one of david cronenberg's favourite thematic stomping grounds, but also shares the canadian director's ballardian [ 10 ] allusions, hyper-masculinity and homoerotic undertones. when the film's antagonist, yatsu (meaning 'guy') - a metal fetishist (played by tsukamoto himself) suffering from the same man-machine affliction - arrives at the apartment, he turns up 'presenting flowers to the salaryman in a parody of courtship'[ 11 ] that ends with physical assimilation. this mechanical eros continues when, in an early stage of his transformation, the salaryman's penis turns into a rapidly oscillating drill which he then uses on his girlfriend with graphic results. by the film's end, he does battle and fuses together with the metal fetishist; the result is a large tank-like monstrosity with the suggested goal of world domination. his newfound unrepressed nature effectively destroys his heterosexual relationship, only to start a new one with someone - another male - experiencing similar changes to their body. the film's metaphorical capacity is achieved primarily through its abstract and surrealist execution that bears similarities to luis buuel's un chien andalou (1929) - as noted by brown in tokyo cyberpunk (p.60-64) - and david lynch's eraserhead. the latter is a popular comparison, prompting many to refer to tetsuo as a japanese eraserhead. whilst both films share an allegiance to post-humanism and industrialised iconography, eraserhead takes a slower burning, atmospheric approach. tetsuo on the other hand, takes a startlingly aggressive stance from the outset; combining hand-held camerawork, rapid fire editing and a pummelling, industrial music score by composer chu ishikawa - who would serve as composer for future tsukamoto projects - to create a battering and invasive sensory assault. it was an ethos that would carry over into the next decade of underground filmmaking. after completing his second feature, the manga adaptation hiruko the goblin (1990), tsukamoto returned to the world of mutated scrap with a second tetsuo film. tetsuo ii: the body hammer (1992) serves more as a companion piece than as a straightforward sequel or remake. it is a new interpretation of the same basic premise - man-machine transformation - but played out on a larger scale. tomorowo taguchi reprises his role as a (different) salaryman. this time, he lives in a sterile, high-rise apartment with his wife and young son. his metamorphosis is triggered when his son is kidnapped by an underground faction of skinheads who want to harness the salaryman's cyber-kinetic powers so that they can augment their bodies into organic weaponry in order to bring about mass destruction. if the ethos of the first tetsuo was related to the fly, the second film perhaps bears more of a similarity to cronenberg's scanners (1981) as the salaryman comes to blows against his mutated brother (played by tsukamoto), the leader of the skinhead group. in doing so, body hammer moves away from the surreal macabre horror of its predecessor and more towards an action/science fiction movie template; although plenty of avant-garde trimmings still remain to bridge, connect and embellish ideas. as a result, tsukamoto operates within a somewhat more conventional and ultimately, more accessible narrative structure, and the inclusion of a larger budget means that he is able to fully realise the end-of-the-world scenario suggested in the closing moments of the first film. as per tsukamoto's wish, tokyo is razed to the ground. like the first film, body hammer blurs the distinction between form and content. it also re-imagines concepts that were given little attention the first time around; the metal fetishist's obsession with physical perfection as suggested by the photos of successful athletes that adorn his shack like abode is 'brought very much to the foreground in the shape of the skinhead cult, which consists of athletes, bodybuilders and boxers who push their training regimen to the extreme' [ 12 ] - a topic that would dominate tsukamoto's subsequent film project. it's a possible indictment of the obsessive, body culture phenomenon that came about in the 1980s that saw more and more people going to the gym and taking advantage of artificial enhancements such as plastic surgery; a time when there was a strong emphasis on physical perfection and beauty. the film also hints at the direction tsukamoto would start to take with future productions: the environmental focus has shifted ever so slightly from the decaying urban sprawl to the sterile functionality of the metropolis centre, and more of an emphasis has been placed on the relationship between the salaryman and his wife; a marriage torn apart by invasive elements. the catalyst for transformation this time is not from infection or a curse as suggested in the original, but from demonstrative rage. the prospect of the salaryman's son being killed by the skinheads provokes the first instance of transformation, which occurs again when his wife is kidnapped, causing multiple gun-barrels to erupt from his chest and limbs. rage would go on to transform tsukamoto's protagonists in future films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998), albeit figuratively instead of literally. when mental anguish exceeds physical pain: pinocchio 946 and rubber's lover in the wake of tetsuo's startling domestic and international success, one would think that it would have acted as a catalyst to trigger a wave of similarly styled films. in retrospect, this wasn't the case as very few filmmakers decided to follow the path forged by tsukamoto's breakthrough work. however, former colleague shozin fukui was one of the few to accept the challenge. like tsukamoto and izumiya before him, fukui is a disciple of sogo ishii's breakthrough independent filmmaking during the late seventies as well as the music that inspired it. born in 1961, and upon moving to tokyo in the early eighties, fukui quickly became infatuated with the burgeoning underground punk music scene and set about forming his own band with friends. these same friends would serve as fukui's cast and crew on early forays into filmmaking such as metal days (1986) and the short films gerorisuto (1986) and caterpillar (1988) [ 13 ]. after serving as assistant director to both tsukamoto and ishii - on tetsuo: the iron man and the short film the master of shiatsu (shiatsu oja, 1989) respectively - fukui started to write and direct his own feature films. his first was pinocchio 964 (1991), and while it did not share the same philosophical leanings that tetsuo did two years before, it was an effective manifesto for fukui's thematic preoccupations nonetheless; how technological augmentation impacts on the fragile and potentially volatile nature of the human mind. the story focuses on the titular protagonist, a brainwashed individual who has been scientifically modified to operate as a sex slave. upon being thrown away by his sexually demanding female owners, pinocchio wonders the streets of present-day tokyo where he meets himiko, a fellow destitute. she takes pinocchio under her wing whereby he begins to fall in love with her, prompting the return of previously erased memories. when pinocchio realises what has happened to him and knows who's responsible, he plans revenge. meanwhile, the corporation in question organise a search party to reclaim their missing product. pinocchio 964 is frequently compared to tetsuo by cyberpunk enthusiasts and academics alike. both films represent the feature length debut of fukui and tsukamoto respectively and both films exhibit a similarly energetic and manic execution. it can be argued that fukui's style is indebted to tsukamoto due to his serving as assistant director for a period of tetsuo's filming. fukui's previous short, caterpillar - made at around the same time as tetsuo - features similar techniques including hyperactive, hand-held camerawork and stop-motion animation as well as similar imagery: mounds of scrap, ubiquitous urban living and flesh merged with machinery. however, there are some major differences. the most apparent is inherent in the film's mise en scene: pinocchio 964 is in colour (except for its opening sequence) whereas tetsuo is black and white - though its sequel was in colour. thematically, unlike tsukamoto's notion of technology as an organic, mutating disease, fukui's film depicts the body transformed as the direct result of man-made augmentation similar to early cronenberg - shivers (1975) and rabid (1977) for example - as well as mary shelley's frankenstein (1818). like the monster in shelley's seminal work, pinocchio is at first oblivious to his condition, but time spent in the real world causes him to realise his artificial existence and he seeks revenge against his creator. however, unlike frankenstein's monster, pinocchio was not constructed from scratch; he is his namesake in reverse - a human turned product through neuro tampering and memory wiping. fukui seems to suggest that modernity is programming the populous to concern themselves with nothing but sex; a sentiment that's readily apparent in the media and advertising industries. it could be argued then, that pinocchio 964 is the more precise cyberpunk text, offering a speculative stance on potential future technologies i.e. altered living through cybernetic assistance. as suggested in tetsuo, these technological changes have a perverse impact on sex; pinocchio is compelled to suckle on himiko's breasts in a brain-damaged, baby like stupor - not knowing any better - whereas the salaryman's girlfriend is enticed and drawn to ride her lover's newly developed drill-penis. the conclusion of pinocchio 964 sees further transformation beyond the esoteric boundaries as previously established. like the salaryman and metal fetishist, pinocchio and himiko - both of whom are victims of the corporation's scientific dalliances - merge together in a manner and style reminiscent of peter jackson's first lo-fi feature bad taste (1987), suggesting the start of a new, technologically altered meta-race in keeping with cronenberg's corporeal philosophy of the new flesh [ 14 ]. thanks to tetsuo's worldwide success - along with other newly emerging work like takashi kitano's gritty police caper violent cop (1989) - pinocchio 964 enjoyed a modicum of cult success as international demand for strange and ultra-violent japanese cinema began to increase. film companies such as toho started to cater to this newfound interest by introducing direct-to-video distribution lines that specialised in outputting low-budget, sensationalist material. one such entry was tomoo haraguchi's specifically titled mikadroid: robokill beneath disco club layla (1991), a cyber/steampunk horror about a buried, technologically augmented, super-soldier - built by japanese scientists during the second world war - being re-activated and going on a murderous rampage. largely unheard of, the film is perhaps most notable for featuring a (brief) acting turn from a then little-known kiyoshi kurosawa, who would later go on to direct internationally renowned works such as cure (1997), pulse (2001) and tokyo sonata (2008). both pinocchio 964 and mikadroid would be overshadowed by tsukamoto's higher budget and higher profile tetsuo sequel, which arrived the following year. in the meantime, fukui was already planning the next project; one that would take almost five years to gestate and execute. the result was rubber's lover (1996), fukui's second and, at present, last feature; a subterranean post-industrial nightmare of human experimentation and bodily destruction. a clandestine group of scientists experiment on human guinea pigs pinched from the street to unlock psychic powers. this is achieved through a combination of computer interfaces, sensory depravation and regular injections of ether, usually resulting in the subject dying a gruesome and explosive death. often interpreted as a lose prequel to pinocchio v946, rubber's lover, despite similarities to its predecessor also represents a distinct contrast. the most readily apparent differences are the film's use of monochrome photography - a decision made by fukui when he disliked the look of the sm flavoured costumes when filmed in colour - and the film's comparatively subdued pace; favouring atmosphere over propulsion. however, his pre-established tropes still remain: invasive technologies; bizarre sexual practices as a by-product of such technologies; retrograde/outdated equipment; mutation; and a fetish for bodily fluids - pus, blood, vomit etc. like tetsuo, rubber's lover depicts the establishment of a new world order through corporeal and technologically informed symbiosis: the biological co-existence between flesh and metal and the destruction of mental and physical barriers respectively. rubber's lover also takes great pleasure in distorting the boundaries and exploring the grey area between sex and violence; much more so than pinocchio 964. one scene sees a frenzied character tearing the flesh off another, mid-coitus on a hospital bed whilst a corporate scumbag laughs in the corner of the room. the researcher's successful test subject, motomiya - a former member of the team who has since become addicted to ether - is made to wear a strange, rubber sm bodysuit, further augmented with makeshift technological add-ons of monitors, wires and outdated gizmos. their nurse's rotating, ether injector is especially phallic and is used on their subjects rectally for immediate effect, suggesting a notion of perversion that transcends sex and violence and into the realms of science and technology. rubber's lover's perverted view on science not only echoes some of the imagery and themes from izumiya's death powder (and to a lesser extent, haraguchi's mikadroid) but the real-life, deranged human experiments carried out by the japanese military's infamous unit 731 on chinese prisoners of war during the 1930s and 40s [ 15 ]; depicting a doomsday scenario that sees the human race tear itself apart in the pursuit of scientific understanding and technological superiority. motomiya's ether addiction is caused by one of his research colleagues. the same colleague later kidnaps and rapes a representative of the project's benefactor sent in to oversee its shutdown. she is also subjugated to d.d.d (direct digital drive), the apparatus used in the project's testing. fukui's fascination over the frailty and destructibility of the human mind comes to fruition as motomiya quickly turns mad; burdened with newly unlocked psychic powers that he can't control. like pinocchio 964, rubber's lover examines the mental transformation that invasive technologies incur on the human condition. this is in stark contrast to tsukamoto's tetsuo films that focus primarily on the physical transformation caused by the same factors, which perhaps serves as the key difference between their otherwise similar films within the sub-genre. ishii's second revolution: electric dragon 80,000v  by the mid-to-late 1990s, japanese cyberpunk cinema was starting to wane; having been overtaken by the blood-stained yakuza films of kitano and miike in terms of international prominence, who would in turn be overshadowed by the new wave of supernatural, j-horror films that emerged at the turn of the century including hideo nakata's the ring (1998) and ring 2 (1999). fukui's rubber's lover was the last underground cyberpunk film of the nineties and arguably the last ever. upon its completion and after getting a limited video release, fukui put filmmaking on hold to join a video production company; he worked there for the best part of ten years. tsukamoto had moved on also, continuing his exploration of the symbiosis between city and citizen with a matured pallet. his films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998) eschew virtually all of the science fiction and horror imagery that had characterised his work previously. cyberpunk was kept alive within japan's anime and manga industries but it wasn't until the turn of the millennium when it returned to cinema. the year 2001 saw the release of two films that would give the genre a new lease of life. mamoru oshii made avalon, a live-action japanese/polish co-production about an addictive virtual simulation game. it was oshii's first film since his internationally successful anime feature film adaptation of ghost in the shell (1995) - he would go on to direct the sequel; ghost in the shell 2: innocence (2004). shot in poland with polish actors and a japanese crew, avalon's themes of virtual reality places it in the same territory as a lot of american produced cyberpunk that surfaced during the nineties: the lawnmower man (1992), strange days (1995), the thirteenth floor (1999), the matrix (1999) and cronenberg's similarly concerned existenz (1999) for example. it was also redolent of many similarly themed anime releases - both theatrical and televised - that emerged during the same decade as the real-life phenomenon of the internet started to make the world seem even smaller; oshii's own adaptation of ghost in the shell and ryutaro nakamura's serial experiments: lain (1998) series were particularly indicative of these technological and cultural changes. another notable example and precursor to much of the vr-centric work that would appear in the 1990s is the four-part anime series megazone 23 (1985-1989), which explores the idea of a post-apocalyptic tokyo existing as a futuristic virtual simulation. the second film from 2001 was sogo ishii's electric dragon 80,000v, which not only served as ishii's return to punk cinema after a decade of more meditative output but, like burst city, spearheaded a new generation of like minded filmmaking that has evolved japanese cyberpunk into a new and strange beast. as with the sensory assault cinema favoured by tsukamoto and fukui, electric dragon is a film that is experienced rather than watched, stimulating the most primitive parts of the brain in a tsunami of sound and image. the premise is simple enough; a young boy contracts the ability to channel and wield electricity, acquired from a childhood accident whilst climbing some power lines - an ability further enhanced by receiving multiple jolts of electro-shock therapy for violent behaviour. now an adult with megawatts of power coursing through him, dragon eye morrison is a professional reptile investigator, searching alleyways for lost lizards. equilibrium is disturbed by the arrival of thunderbolt buddha, a tv repair man turned vigilante whose electro-conductive talents are the result of mechanical wizardry. the two meet and battle for supremacy on tokyo's rooftops. as was the case with burst city, electric dragon leans less towards the cyber and more towards the punk aspect of the sub-genre, with ishii following the train of thought he employed with his music videos and concert films during the 1980s. the film's title also makes reference to the old days, partly derived from 'live spot 20,000v', the concert venue that plays a pivotal role in burst city and one of ishii's early shorts, the solitude of one divided by 880,000 (1978). electric dragon is less about the nightmare and more about anarchic expression at odds with the post-modern universe. however, some cyber signifiers do remain; the oppressive tokyo setting realised in stark monochrome; the fetishist attitude towards power lines, aerials, ventilation ducts and other ubiquitous technological appliances; the hyperactive and frequently expressionist delivery; its low-budget, guerrilla-like execution and, like tetsuo, the concept of two characters augmented through technology, giving them powers that they can't fully control, coming to blows. dragon eye morrison has to clamp himself to a metal bed frame at night whilst thunderbolt buddha's penchants for electronic devices to assist in his nocturnal excursions sometimes get the better of him as he fights for control of his own body. the psycho-sexual themes that dominated past japanese cyberpunk have been replaced with an equally primal notion of animal magnetism. morrison's electric power is derived from the 'dragon' that's embedded in all living things. his rage unlocks the strength of the dragon, meaning that he can harness more energy by sucking it out of household appliances or by creating a non-melodic racket on his electric guitar; a high-voltage cacophony of noise and expression announcing that ishii's punk spirit is still alive and well. indeed, lead actor tadanobu asano occasionally guests in ishii's industrial noise-punk ensemble mach 1.67, which provided the film's propulsive soundtrack. the film would later be used to accompany the group's live shows, a strategy ishii pioneered back in 1983 when he made the short film asia strikes back - a little-known cyberpunk piece that provided the template for shozin fukui's preferred set-up of underground experiments gone haywire - to back up the album and tour of the short-lived punk supergroup the bacillus army. similar to tsukamoto's tetsuo, dialogue in electric dragon 80,000v is minimal thus the narrative is powered mainly by image and follows a similar template; the protagonist is seen acquiring his power; the antagonist then challenges the protagonist to combat and the final act sees them clash. all of this is wrapped up in a high energy, fatless sixty-minute package. ishii's film is not only is a throwback to the eighties cyberpunk manifesto but reminds us that rather than being characterised by heavy, science fiction concepts, as was the case in the west, it was defined by its independence, attitude and the will to create something out of nothing. the rise of 'splatter-punk' in the years following electric dragon 80,000v, a new wave of low-budget horror/science fiction began to surface largely thanks to increased dvd distribution channels, cheaper production techniques and the ever increasing reach of the internet. films like hellevator: the bottled fools (hiroki yamaguchi, 2004), meatball machine (yudai yamaguchi  junichi yamamoto, 2005), the machine girl (noboru iguchi, 2008) and tokyo gore police (yoshihiro nishimura, 2008) have ushered in a new era of cyberpunk informed, gore-centric movies that have since been termed 'splatter-punk'. these splatter-punk movies share the same independent spirit of their precursors, substituting 8mm and 16mm film methods for cheap dv technology, retaining as much budget as possible for make-up, costume and practical effects. many of the effects in these films depict mutation and body alteration; splatter re-imaginings of the flesh-metal fusions of tetsuo, and the perverse, organic weaponry of tetsuo ii. similar to the splatstick horror of early sam raimi and peter jackson, the effects and transformations lean towards the ridiculous for comedic effect. one mutated character in tokyo gore police wields an oversized cannon made of contorted flesh, protruding from his crotch much like an erect penis, suggesting - in a very tongue-in-cheek manner - the blur between sex and violence that was posited by tsukamoto and fukui. yamaguchi and yamamoto's meatball machine is perhaps the closest to the japanese cyberpunk of old; parasitic aliens infect unsuspecting people, which promptly turns them into macabre man-machine teratoids that fight it out. in many ways, this 'splatter-punk' phase is also reminiscent of the special-effects race that occurred with american horror movies during the 1980s; cronenberg included. as practical effects became more advanced, a seemingly never-ending slew of films were produced, trying to out-shock one another with advancing exercises in gore. the same can be said here; the ante seems to be continually raised as each new release contorts and morphs the body in increasingly elaborate and grotesque ways. a reason for this is that many of these film's directors initially came from special effects backgrounds: tokyo gore police director yoshihiro nishimura for instance, has supervised the special effects for many modern gore productions including noboru iguchi's the machine girl and robo-geisha (2009). in fact, many of these films are made through fundoshi corps, a production company founded by nishimura, iguchi and film producer yukihiko yamaguchi, that specialise in cheaply produced, over-the-top movies of this ilk. it has proven to be a successful business model as their output is continually building a strong international fanbase, looking for perverse and outlandish content. the recurring touchstones of combining eroticism and perversion are also present. however, they for the most part forego subverted techno-fetishism in favour of contemporary v-cinema and pink film preoccupations. the machine girl for instance, uses typical imagery such as the japanese schoolgirl - a popular conceit in a lot of the nation's anime, manga and pornography industries - and takes it to new abject levels, connecting bullet spewing hardware to her severed limbs and even granting her the ability to grow weaponry from out of the small of her spine; skirt raised of course. unfortunately, it would appear that live-action japanese cyberpunk cinema has moved on from the daring, experimental underground from whence it came. the remnants of its ideas are now utilised in violent gore shockers that are bereft of the immediacy and philosophical potential of their progenitors. the movement, once an expression of attitude, concerns and frustration with the world, the way it's structured and the technology used - not just an exploration of the grey area between science fiction and horror - seems to have disappeared. however in 2009, shinya tsukamoto announced his return to the world of cyberpunk with a third tetsuo project. tetsuo: the bullet man is not only a return, but a new beginning for tsukamoto as it is his first english language film; an attempt to expose the demented world of tetsuo to a wider audience. it premiered at the 2009 venice film festival to mixed fanfare, prompting tsukamoto to continue working on it. subsequent showings - the 2010 tribeca festival for instance - have found greater critical favour, but a vital caveat still remains like the punk scene that it emulated, japanese cyberpunk was pertinent and inextricably linked to a specific time and place. more than a sub-genre, it tackled the anxieties of the period in ways that conventional expression would fall short. but now that we're in the technologically dependent twenty-first century - the post-human nightmare now a grim reality - can it still be relevant? references  endnotes [ 1 ]. sogo ishii's biographical details were adapted from an interview with the director conducted by tom mes for www.midnighteye.com (posted 06/15/2005) [ 2 ]. 1982/1983 would prove to be a crucial time in the international development of cyberpunk. this period saw the release of four highly influential texts: sogo ishii's burst city (1982), ridley scott's blade runner (1982), the initial publishing of katsuhiro otomo's akira manga series (1982-1990) and david cronenberg's videodrome (1983).

a style that would be explored later in otomo's highly influential akira. originally made as a university graduation project, it was picked up for distribution by major studio toei, making ishii the first of his generation to move from amateur filmmaking into the professional industry while still a university student [ 1 ]. after crazy thunder road, ishii made the frenetic short film shuffle (1981) - interestingly, an unofficial adaptation of a katsuhiro otomo comic strip - as well as a slew of music and concert videos for a variety of japanese punk bands. however, toei soon returned, offering ishii studio backing for his next feature film project. this new financial investment resulted in ishii's most influential work to date; burst city (1982), a film that encapsulated and epitomised his favourite subject matter: the punk movement. no other film captured the intensity, pessimism, delinquency and the do-it-yourself bravado of japan's punk movement like ishii's burst city; a bold, brash and anarchic time-capsule of early eighties zeitgeist. however, despite its overwhelming influence - not only did it shape the conventions of japanese cyberpunk, but the future of contemporary japanese cinema as a whole - burst city remains largely unappreciated. it is frequently overshadowed by its higher profile, more internationally renowned followers: tsukamoto, takashi miike and takeshi kitano among others, all of whom are indebted to ishii's work in some shape or form. however, ishii has always played the rebel: attending his filmmaking class at nihon university only when he needed to borrow more equipment; dropping off the filmmaking radar for long stretches of time; making films of a commercially unviable length such as the 55-minute electric dragon 80,000v (2001) and challenging conventional moviegoers with his early punk films only then to defy the fans of that work with calm, hypnotic efforts such as august in the water (1995) and labyrinth of dreams (1997). it is this ethos that drives burst city; steering it through the deserted tokyo highways and barren industrial wastelands that make up its initial exposition and into the anarchic meltdown of its closing act. the visual aesthetic of burst city is an eclectic mix of punk, industrialisation and post-apocalyptic wasteland imagery reminiscent of the first two mad max films (1979  1981), with some science fiction trimmings; the futuristic cannons used by the battle police to disperse riots for instance. however, burst city acts beyond the usual genre trappings. it has the immediacy and atmosphere of a documentary, chronicling both the people and the music, whilst using the surrounding dystopian backdrop as a metaphor for the anxiety, haplessness and alienation as experienced by japan's youth at the time. this documentary feel is further enhanced by ishii's groundbreaking use of camera. his highly dynamic, handheld, almost stream-of-consciousness style shots interwoven with equally aggressive, machinegun editing not only captures the energy and restlessness of the music - which is very prominent here - but would highly influence tsukamoto and the execution of his work. the film's industrialised environments - the abandoned warehouses and run-down boiler rooms where the biker gangs and punk bands reside - would become a key aspect for the japanese cyberpunk look as well as depicting tokyo as little more than a concrete slum. the notion of the metropolis as oppressive entity starts to become apparent here and it's interesting to note that this film was made in the same year as blade runner, which again, displays similar connotations [ 2 ]. ishii's prior involvement with the punk movement allowed him to gather an impressive ensemble of real-life japanese punk bands - the rockers, the roosters and the stalin among others - as part of the cast, as well as 1970s folk singer/songwriter shigeru izumiya. interestingly, izumiya was also credited as a planner and the film's art director, suggesting that he had a strong involvement in shaping burst city's influential aesthetic. this serves as a vital link as izumiya would go on to write and direct his own film; a film that would go on to crystallise many of the conventions and ideas of japanese cyberpunk that would later be explored by tsukamoto and fukui. shigeru izumiya's death powder (1986) introduces the unorthodox visuals and abstract delivery that would prove instrumental in future japanese cyberpunk execution. like burst city, sound also plays a vital part here; further laying the foundations for the sensory assault aspect of the movement that would later be championed and refined by tsukamoto. izumiya, like ishii, is from a musical background; a popular folk singer/songwriter as well as a film composer - he wrote the music for ishii's breakthrough feature crazy thunder road. lost in public domain purgatory for decades, death powder barely exists, available on bootleg dvd and only recently as video segments on the internet [ 3 ]. western understanding of the film has been largely incoherent and underwhelming due to bad and partial translation into english and as a result, death powder is frequently overlooked. however, its influence is unmistakably clear and it's arguably the first film of japan's extreme cyberpunk movement, exemplifying the invasive, corporeal surrealism that would follow over the next ten years. set in present or near-future tokyo, the film follows a group of researchers who have in their possession guernica; a feminine, cybernetic android capable of spewing poisonous dust from its mouth. karima (played by izumiya) is left to guard the android but appears to lose his mind, attacking the other two - noris and kiyoshi - when they return. kiyoshi inhales some of guernica's powder and starts to mutate as a result. he also starts hallucinating as their subconscious starts to merge. one sequence entitled dr. loo made me - which suggests that the android is trying to communicate with kiyoshi - sees the guernica project in its early stages featuring the three researchers as well as the eccentric dr. loo, the guitar wielding head of the operation. the hallucinations provide kiyoshi with further omniscience, detailing karima's apparent love for guernica as well as the research group's ongoing struggle with the 'scar people'; men disfigured as their flesh deteriorates uncontrollably. the subject of flesh, the boundary between life and death and the notion of what it means to be human come into play regularly as the film drifts from one surrealist situation to another. death powder poses the question: if you cease to have flesh, do you cease to be human? this is an idea that is routinely explored in cyberpunk but while western examples such as blade runner and neuromancer focus on larger-scale implications, death powder - and most of japan's subsequent cyberpunk output for that matter - looks at the changes within the individual. with the former; invasive technologies are not only fully realised, but have been successfully integrated into society, thus becoming common practice. the technologies explored in the latter however, are still in their primordial stages; they are works in progress and extremely esoteric, and as a result, extremely volatile and unpredictable.  death powder also establishes japanese cyberpunk's tendency to place imagery ahead of its narrative, a fundamental aspect of the no-holds barred sensory assault style that they exhibit. as a result, story and purpose are evinced from what is seen as opposed to what is told, allowing subsequent films a tonal and philosophical quality. like many similar spirited films that would follow, death powder highlights the destructive and dehumanising nature of technology. a big clue comes in the form of the android guernica sharing the same name as pablo picasso's famous 1937 painting that depicts the bombing of guernica by nazi warplanes (in support of franco) during the spanish civil war. picasso's mural shows an orgy of twisted bodies, animals and buildings, deformed by war, or more broadly, the deviant technologies that power it. the film's end sees the cast fused and writhing in an ocean of monstrous flesh; the human form consumed and destroyed at the hands of intervening science. despite death powder's aesthetic and thematic influence, it went by with little fanfare and was never seen outside of japan until years later. the subsequent, similar minded android of notre dame (kuramoto; 1988) fared slightly better, partly due to the infamy that surrounded the film series it was part of, a seven-film collection known as the guinea pig series; short exploitation features that focused on torture, murder and other destructive processes, designed to appear realistic and snuff-like [ 4 ]. android of notre dame failed to strike a chord with wider audiences and has since wallowed in cult obscurity along with its filmic brethren. however, this all changed as japanese cyberpunk began to creep into the international spotlight with the anime feature film adaptation of katsuhiro otomo's popular manga series, akira (1988). although this writing focuses mainly on live-action cyberpunk output, akira's arrival was so important and influential to the sub-genre that it needs to be acknowledged. akira achieved two things: first; it opened up and, almost single-handedly, popularised anime and manga for global audiences (especially in the uk and us) and second; it perpetuated the cyberpunk ethos on perhaps the largest scale to date - combining the neon-lit, high-technology/low-living metropolis of blade runner and neuromancer with body horror overtones. the film condensed the vast narrative of otomo's gargantuan, six-part magnum opus into a streamlined, two-hour feature directed by otomo himself. it is a milestone within japanese cyberpunk as it was the first of the sub-genre to not only have commercial success domestically, but also managed to find an audience overseas. set within the destitute overcrowding of futuristic neo tokyo, the story revolves around juvenile biker thugs and best friends kaneda and tetsuo. during a turf spat with a rival gang, tetsuo crashes but is mysteriously taken away by military and scientific officials. they experiment on him with chemically altering drugs, turning tetsuo into a psycho-kinetic demigod with uncontrollable power. he goes on a destructive rampage through the city to seek an audience with akira, a highly powerful entity that destroyed the old tokyo decades before. part of akira's success inevitably lies in its attention to detail and vaulting ambition. the budget was astronomical for an anime feature at the time - around 1,100,000,000 [ 5 ] - acquired through the partnership of several major japanese media companies including toho and bandai. it avoided the corner cutting of anime projects in the past, producing hundreds of thousands of animation cells to create fluid motion - particularly in its many action set-pieces - and capture nuances that would've otherwise not existed. otomo also went to the trouble of doing lip-synched sound recording; a first for anime, resulting in extremely high and rich production values. the film set box office records for an anime in japan during its summer 1988 release, grossing over 6,300,000,000 [ 6 ]. internationally, it got a limited theatrical run in america and the united kingdom soon after - sowing the seeds for the immense western cult fanbase that it enjoys to this day - but failed to get home video distribution until the early nineties. themes of mutation, modernity and social unrest are rife. kaneda and tetsuo's biker gang are like a revved up version of the delinquents seen in ishii's crazy thunder road and burst city, while tetsuo's esp and subsequent transformation sets the film firmly in cronenberg's body horror territory. his eventual fusion with metal - resulting in a horrific man-machine hybrid that sees tetsuo become the master of a newly formed universe - not only is evocative of the cyberpunk notion of technology corrupting the human form (in this case literally) but also serves as an important visual precursor to the movement's next breakthrough, live-action work. metal-morphosis: tetsuo: the iron man and tetsuo ii: the body hammer often revered as the definitive example of extreme japanese cyberpunk and a vital cornerstone in the rebuilding of contemporary japanese cinema, tetsuo: the iron man was a baffling international success story, prompting many a sceptic on japan's future cinematic involvement to turn their attention eastward. barely over an hour in length, tetsuo was a breath of fresh air; a no-holds-barred sensory assault that gave japanese cinema a major image renovation and launched the career of its director, shinya tsukamoto, who has gone on to become one of the country's most respected and treasured auteurs. during its unprecedented and lengthy tour of international film festivals, tetsuo not only pointed towards exciting new possibilities for contemporary japanese cinema but was able to fit 'snugly into a pantheon of genre works that included ridley scott's blade runner, james cameron's the terminator, david lynch's eraserhead and the work of david cronenberg, sam raimi and clive barker'[ 7 ], which no doubt broadened its appeal. its use of kinetic cinematography, rapid-fire editing and diy, zero-budget special effects served as an invitation; a call to arms if you will, for independent filmmakers everywhere to produce unique and challenging cinema. however, the majority of the film's innovative style is, for the most part, lifted from elsewhere, promoting the fusion of a variety of influences including the hyperactive camerawork of ishii's burst city; the body horror of cronenberg's videodrome (1983) and the fly (1986); the biomechanical perversions of artist h.r. giger; the literature of j.g. ballard - particularly crash (1973) - and the stop-motion animation of jan svankmayer. there is also a sense of strange nostalgia for the old kaiju (monster) movies and television serials that tsukamoto watched when growing up in a tokyo experiencing post-war re-construction as well as major expansion and modernising in preparation for the japan hosting of the 1964 olympic games. like ishii, tsukamoto's early development stemmed from making 8mm films as a teenager during the 1970s, using his younger brother and friends as cast and crew members. as he reached adulthood, tsukamoto abandoned filmmaking and turned his attention increasingly towards the stage, forming a theatre troupe with like minded university students and directing plays [ 8 ]. one of the plays that tsukamoto wrote would subsequently be adapted into a film; the adventure of denchu kozo (1987) with the assistance of his theatre cohorts - christened 'kaiju theatre'. it was this same group that also made tetsuo, along with a revolving-door line-up of other helpers, most notably fellow filmmaker shozin fukui who would go to make his own cyberpunk features during the nineties. tetsuo's chief concern is the impact of technology on society and subsequently - and more specifically - the human form. tsukamoto suggests that technology is a disease, bursting forth unannounced and unexplained as evidenced in the salaryman's transformation - simultaneously reminiscent of cronenberg's the fly and otomo's akira - where a shard of metal lodged in the protagonist's cheek is the starting point for further mutation. like seth brundle of the fly, the salaryman is both repulsed yet intrigued by what he is turning into and, coincidently, his evolution shares the namesake of the transforming character of akira: tetsuo; meaning 'iron man' or 'clear thinking/philosophical man'. tsukamoto embraces both interpretations of his film's title. on one hand is the literal transformation of flesh to iron and on the other, a philosophical enquiry on technology's consuming nature and the symbiosis between city and citizen. however, closer inspection reveals further concerns, as evidenced by steven t. brown, author of the groundbreaking tokyo cyberpunk: posthumanism in japanese visual culture, in which he says: 'the mixing of flesh and metal in tetsuo is not only intensely violent but also darkly erotomechanical and techno-fetishistic, evoking sadomasochistic sexual practices and pleasures, as well as fears of both male and female sexuality out of control'[ 9 ]. in this regard, tsukamoto gives horror and eroticism equal attention: the salaryman has a nightmare involving his girlfriend (played by kei fujiwara) sodomising him with a mechanical, snakelike appendage strapped to her crotch. this gender-reversal is not only representative of one of david cronenberg's favourite thematic stomping grounds, but also shares the canadian director's ballardian [ 10 ] allusions, hyper-masculinity and homoerotic undertones. when the film's antagonist, yatsu (meaning 'guy') - a metal fetishist (played by tsukamoto himself) suffering from the same man-machine affliction - arrives at the apartment, he turns up 'presenting flowers to the salaryman in a parody of courtship'[ 11 ] that ends with physical assimilation. this mechanical eros continues when, in an early stage of his transformation, the salaryman's penis turns into a rapidly oscillating drill which he then uses on his girlfriend with graphic results. by the film's end, he does battle and fuses together with the metal fetishist; the result is a large tank-like monstrosity with the suggested goal of world domination. his newfound unrepressed nature effectively destroys his heterosexual relationship, only to start a new one with someone - another male - experiencing similar changes to their body. the film's metaphorical capacity is achieved primarily through its abstract and surrealist execution that bears similarities to luis buuel's un chien andalou (1929) - as noted by brown in tokyo cyberpunk (p.60-64) - and david lynch's eraserhead. the latter is a popular comparison, prompting many to refer to tetsuo as a japanese eraserhead. whilst both films share an allegiance to post-humanism and industrialised iconography, eraserhead takes a slower burning, atmospheric approach. tetsuo on the other hand, takes a startlingly aggressive stance from the outset; combining hand-held camerawork, rapid fire editing and a pummelling, industrial music score by composer chu ishikawa - who would serve as composer for future tsukamoto projects - to create a battering and invasive sensory assault. it was an ethos that would carry over into the next decade of underground filmmaking. after completing his second feature, the manga adaptation hiruko the goblin (1990), tsukamoto returned to the world of mutated scrap with a second tetsuo film. tetsuo ii: the body hammer (1992) serves more as a companion piece than as a straightforward sequel or remake. it is a new interpretation of the same basic premise - man-machine transformation - but played out on a larger scale. tomorowo taguchi reprises his role as a (different) salaryman. this time, he lives in a sterile, high-rise apartment with his wife and young son. his metamorphosis is triggered when his son is kidnapped by an underground faction of skinheads who want to harness the salaryman's cyber-kinetic powers so that they can augment their bodies into organic weaponry in order to bring about mass destruction. if the ethos of the first tetsuo was related to the fly, the second film perhaps bears more of a similarity to cronenberg's scanners (1981) as the salaryman comes to blows against his mutated brother (played by tsukamoto), the leader of the skinhead group. in doing so, body hammer moves away from the surreal macabre horror of its predecessor and more towards an action/science fiction movie template; although plenty of avant-garde trimmings still remain to bridge, connect and embellish ideas. as a result, tsukamoto operates within a somewhat more conventional and ultimately, more accessible narrative structure, and the inclusion of a larger budget means that he is able to fully realise the end-of-the-world scenario suggested in the closing moments of the first film. as per tsukamoto's wish, tokyo is razed to the ground. like the first film, body hammer blurs the distinction between form and content. it also re-imagines concepts that were given little attention the first time around; the metal fetishist's obsession with physical perfection as suggested by the photos of successful athletes that adorn his shack like abode is 'brought very much to the foreground in the shape of the skinhead cult, which consists of athletes, bodybuilders and boxers who push their training regimen to the extreme' [ 12 ] - a topic that would dominate tsukamoto's subsequent film project. it's a possible indictment of the obsessive, body culture phenomenon that came about in the 1980s that saw more and more people going to the gym and taking advantage of artificial enhancements such as plastic surgery; a time when there was a strong emphasis on physical perfection and beauty. the film also hints at the direction tsukamoto would start to take with future productions: the environmental focus has shifted ever so slightly from the decaying urban sprawl to the sterile functionality of the metropolis centre, and more of an emphasis has been placed on the relationship between the salaryman and his wife; a marriage torn apart by invasive elements. the catalyst for transformation this time is not from infection or a curse as suggested in the original, but from demonstrative rage. the prospect of the salaryman's son being killed by the skinheads provokes the first instance of transformation, which occurs again when his wife is kidnapped, causing multiple gun-barrels to erupt from his chest and limbs. rage would go on to transform tsukamoto's protagonists in future films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998), albeit figuratively instead of literally. when mental anguish exceeds physical pain: pinocchio 946 and rubber's lover in the wake of tetsuo's startling domestic and international success, one would think that it would have acted as a catalyst to trigger a wave of similarly styled films. in retrospect, this wasn't the case as very few filmmakers decided to follow the path forged by tsukamoto's breakthrough work. however, former colleague shozin fukui was one of the few to accept the challenge. like tsukamoto and izumiya before him, fukui is a disciple of sogo ishii's breakthrough independent filmmaking during the late seventies as well as the music that inspired it. born in 1961, and upon moving to tokyo in the early eighties, fukui quickly became infatuated with the burgeoning underground punk music scene and set about forming his own band with friends. these same friends would serve as fukui's cast and crew on early forays into filmmaking such as metal days (1986) and the short films gerorisuto (1986) and caterpillar (1988) [ 13 ]. after serving as assistant director to both tsukamoto and ishii - on tetsuo: the iron man and the short film the master of shiatsu (shiatsu oja, 1989) respectively - fukui started to write and direct his own feature films. his first was pinocchio 964 (1991), and while it did not share the same philosophical leanings that tetsuo did two years before, it was an effective manifesto for fukui's thematic preoccupations nonetheless; how technological augmentation impacts on the fragile and potentially volatile nature of the human mind. the story focuses on the titular protagonist, a brainwashed individual who has been scientifically modified to operate as a sex slave. upon being thrown away by his sexually demanding female owners, pinocchio wonders the streets of present-day tokyo where he meets himiko, a fellow destitute. she takes pinocchio under her wing whereby he begins to fall in love with her, prompting the return of previously erased memories. when pinocchio realises what has happened to him and knows who's responsible, he plans revenge. meanwhile, the corporation in question organise a search party to reclaim their missing product. pinocchio 964 is frequently compared to tetsuo by cyberpunk enthusiasts and academics alike. both films represent the feature length debut of fukui and tsukamoto respectively and both films exhibit a similarly energetic and manic execution. it can be argued that fukui's style is indebted to tsukamoto due to his serving as assistant director for a period of tetsuo's filming. fukui's previous short, caterpillar - made at around the same time as tetsuo - features similar techniques including hyperactive, hand-held camerawork and stop-motion animation as well as similar imagery: mounds of scrap, ubiquitous urban living and flesh merged with machinery. however, there are some major differences. the most apparent is inherent in the film's mise en scene: pinocchio 964 is in colour (except for its opening sequence) whereas tetsuo is black and white - though its sequel was in colour. thematically, unlike tsukamoto's notion of technology as an organic, mutating disease, fukui's film depicts the body transformed as the direct result of man-made augmentation similar to early cronenberg - shivers (1975) and rabid (1977) for example - as well as mary shelley's frankenstein (1818). like the monster in shelley's seminal work, pinocchio is at first oblivious to his condition, but time spent in the real world causes him to realise his artificial existence and he seeks revenge against his creator. however, unlike frankenstein's monster, pinocchio was not constructed from scratch; he is his namesake in reverse - a human turned product through neuro tampering and memory wiping. fukui seems to suggest that modernity is programming the populous to concern themselves with nothing but sex; a sentiment that's readily apparent in the media and advertising industries. it could be argued then, that pinocchio 964 is the more precise cyberpunk text, offering a speculative stance on potential future technologies i.e. altered living through cybernetic assistance. as suggested in tetsuo, these technological changes have a perverse impact on sex; pinocchio is compelled to suckle on himiko's breasts in a brain-damaged, baby like stupor - not knowing any better - whereas the salaryman's girlfriend is enticed and drawn to ride her lover's newly developed drill-penis. the conclusion of pinocchio 964 sees further transformation beyond the esoteric boundaries as previously established. like the salaryman and metal fetishist, pinocchio and himiko - both of whom are victims of the corporation's scientific dalliances - merge together in a manner and style reminiscent of peter jackson's first lo-fi feature bad taste (1987), suggesting the start of a new, technologically altered meta-race in keeping with cronenberg's corporeal philosophy of the new flesh [ 14 ]. thanks to tetsuo's worldwide success - along with other newly emerging work like takashi kitano's gritty police caper violent cop (1989) - pinocchio 964 enjoyed a modicum of cult success as international demand for strange and ultra-violent japanese cinema began to increase. film companies such as toho started to cater to this newfound interest by introducing direct-to-video distribution lines that specialised in outputting low-budget, sensationalist material. one such entry was tomoo haraguchi's specifically titled mikadroid: robokill beneath disco club layla (1991), a cyber/steampunk horror about a buried, technologically augmented, super-soldier - built by japanese scientists during the second world war - being re-activated and going on a murderous rampage. largely unheard of, the film is perhaps most notable for featuring a (brief) acting turn from a then little-known kiyoshi kurosawa, who would later go on to direct internationally renowned works such as cure (1997), pulse (2001) and tokyo sonata (2008). both pinocchio 964 and mikadroid would be overshadowed by tsukamoto's higher budget and higher profile tetsuo sequel, which arrived the following year. in the meantime, fukui was already planning the next project; one that would take almost five years to gestate and execute. the result was rubber's lover (1996), fukui's second and, at present, last feature; a subterranean post-industrial nightmare of human experimentation and bodily destruction. a clandestine group of scientists experiment on human guinea pigs pinched from the street to unlock psychic powers. this is achieved through a combination of computer interfaces, sensory depravation and regular injections of ether, usually resulting in the subject dying a gruesome and explosive death. often interpreted as a lose prequel to pinocchio v946, rubber's lover, despite similarities to its predecessor also represents a distinct contrast. the most readily apparent differences are the film's use of monochrome photography - a decision made by fukui when he disliked the look of the sm flavoured costumes when filmed in colour - and the film's comparatively subdued pace; favouring atmosphere over propulsion. however, his pre-established tropes still remain: invasive technologies; bizarre sexual practices as a by-product of such technologies; retrograde/outdated equipment; mutation; and a fetish for bodily fluids - pus, blood, vomit etc. like tetsuo, rubber's lover depicts the establishment of a new world order through corporeal and technologically informed symbiosis: the biological co-existence between flesh and metal and the destruction of mental and physical barriers respectively. rubber's lover also takes great pleasure in distorting the boundaries and exploring the grey area between sex and violence; much more so than pinocchio 964. one scene sees a frenzied character tearing the flesh off another, mid-coitus on a hospital bed whilst a corporate scumbag laughs in the corner of the room. the researcher's successful test subject, motomiya - a former member of the team who has since become addicted to ether - is made to wear a strange, rubber sm bodysuit, further augmented with makeshift technological add-ons of monitors, wires and outdated gizmos. their nurse's rotating, ether injector is especially phallic and is used on their subjects rectally for immediate effect, suggesting a notion of perversion that transcends sex and violence and into the realms of science and technology. rubber's lover's perverted view on science not only echoes some of the imagery and themes from izumiya's death powder (and to a lesser extent, haraguchi's mikadroid) but the real-life, deranged human experiments carried out by the japanese military's infamous unit 731 on chinese prisoners of war during the 1930s and 40s [ 15 ]; depicting a doomsday scenario that sees the human race tear itself apart in the pursuit of scientific understanding and technological superiority. motomiya's ether addiction is caused by one of his research colleagues. the same colleague later kidnaps and rapes a representative of the project's benefactor sent in to oversee its shutdown. she is also subjugated to d.d.d (direct digital drive), the apparatus used in the project's testing. fukui's fascination over the frailty and destructibility of the human mind comes to fruition as motomiya quickly turns mad; burdened with newly unlocked psychic powers that he can't control. like pinocchio 964, rubber's lover examines the mental transformation that invasive technologies incur on the human condition. this is in stark contrast to tsukamoto's tetsuo films that focus primarily on the physical transformation caused by the same factors, which perhaps serves as the key difference between their otherwise similar films within the sub-genre. ishii's second revolution: electric dragon 80,000v  by the mid-to-late 1990s, japanese cyberpunk cinema was starting to wane; having been overtaken by the blood-stained yakuza films of kitano and miike in terms of international prominence, who would in turn be overshadowed by the new wave of supernatural, j-horror films that emerged at the turn of the century including hideo nakata's the ring (1998) and ring 2 (1999). fukui's rubber's lover was the last underground cyberpunk film of the nineties and arguably the last ever. upon its completion and after getting a limited video release, fukui put filmmaking on hold to join a video production company; he worked there for the best part of ten years. tsukamoto had moved on also, continuing his exploration of the symbiosis between city and citizen with a matured pallet. his films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998) eschew virtually all of the science fiction and horror imagery that had characterised his work previously. cyberpunk was kept alive within japan's anime and manga industries but it wasn't until the turn of the millennium when it returned to cinema. the year 2001 saw the release of two films that would give the genre a new lease of life. mamoru oshii made avalon, a live-action japanese/polish co-production about an addictive virtual simulation game. it was oshii's first film since his internationally successful anime feature film adaptation of ghost in the shell (1995) - he would go on to direct the sequel; ghost in the shell 2: innocence (2004). shot in poland with polish actors and a japanese crew, avalon's themes of virtual reality places it in the same territory as a lot of american produced cyberpunk that surfaced during the nineties: the lawnmower man (1992), strange days (1995), the thirteenth floor (1999), the matrix (1999) and cronenberg's similarly concerned existenz (1999) for example. it was also redolent of many similarly themed anime releases - both theatrical and televised - that emerged during the same decade as the real-life phenomenon of the internet started to make the world seem even smaller; oshii's own adaptation of ghost in the shell and ryutaro nakamura's serial experiments: lain (1998) series were particularly indicative of these technological and cultural changes. another notable example and precursor to much of the vr-centric work that would appear in the 1990s is the four-part anime series megazone 23 (1985-1989), which explores the idea of a post-apocalyptic tokyo existing as a futuristic virtual simulation. the second film from 2001 was sogo ishii's electric dragon 80,000v, which not only served as ishii's return to punk cinema after a decade of more meditative output but, like burst city, spearheaded a new generation of like minded filmmaking that has evolved japanese cyberpunk into a new and strange beast. as with the sensory assault cinema favoured by tsukamoto and fukui, electric dragon is a film that is experienced rather than watched, stimulating the most primitive parts of the brain in a tsunami of sound and image. the premise is simple enough; a young boy contracts the ability to channel and wield electricity, acquired from a childhood accident whilst climbing some power lines - an ability further enhanced by receiving multiple jolts of electro-shock therapy for violent behaviour. now an adult with megawatts of power coursing through him, dragon eye morrison is a professional reptile investigator, searching alleyways for lost lizards. equilibrium is disturbed by the arrival of thunderbolt buddha, a tv repair man turned vigilante whose electro-conductive talents are the result of mechanical wizardry. the two meet and battle for supremacy on tokyo's rooftops. as was the case with burst city, electric dragon leans less towards the cyber and more towards the punk aspect of the sub-genre, with ishii following the train of thought he employed with his music videos and concert films during the 1980s. the film's title also makes reference to the old days, partly derived from 'live spot 20,000v', the concert venue that plays a pivotal role in burst city and one of ishii's early shorts, the solitude of one divided by 880,000 (1978). electric dragon is less about the nightmare and more about anarchic expression at odds with the post-modern universe. however, some cyber signifiers do remain; the oppressive tokyo setting realised in stark monochrome; the fetishist attitude towards power lines, aerials, ventilation ducts and other ubiquitous technological appliances; the hyperactive and frequently expressionist delivery; its low-budget, guerrilla-like execution and, like tetsuo, the concept of two characters augmented through technology, giving them powers that they can't fully control, coming to blows. dragon eye morrison has to clamp himself to a metal bed frame at night whilst thunderbolt buddha's penchants for electronic devices to assist in his nocturnal excursions sometimes get the better of him as he fights for control of his own body. the psycho-sexual themes that dominated past japanese cyberpunk have been replaced with an equally primal notion of animal magnetism. morrison's electric power is derived from the 'dragon' that's embedded in all living things. his rage unlocks the strength of the dragon, meaning that he can harness more energy by sucking it out of household appliances or by creating a non-melodic racket on his electric guitar; a high-voltage cacophony of noise and expression announcing that ishii's punk spirit is still alive and well. indeed, lead actor tadanobu asano occasionally guests in ishii's industrial noise-punk ensemble mach 1.67, which provided the film's propulsive soundtrack. the film would later be used to accompany the group's live shows, a strategy ishii pioneered back in 1983 when he made the short film asia strikes back - a little-known cyberpunk piece that provided the template for shozin fukui's preferred set-up of underground experiments gone haywire - to back up the album and tour of the short-lived punk supergroup the bacillus army. similar to tsukamoto's tetsuo, dialogue in electric dragon 80,000v is minimal thus the narrative is powered mainly by image and follows a similar template; the protagonist is seen acquiring his power; the antagonist then challenges the protagonist to combat and the final act sees them clash. all of this is wrapped up in a high energy, fatless sixty-minute package. ishii's film is not only is a throwback to the eighties cyberpunk manifesto but reminds us that rather than being characterised by heavy, science fiction concepts, as was the case in the west, it was defined by its independence, attitude and the will to create something out of nothing. the rise of 'splatter-punk' in the years following electric dragon 80,000v, a new wave of low-budget horror/science fiction began to surface largely thanks to increased dvd distribution channels, cheaper production techniques and the ever increasing reach of the internet. films like hellevator: the bottled fools (hiroki yamaguchi, 2004), meatball machine (yudai yamaguchi  junichi yamamoto, 2005), the machine girl (noboru iguchi, 2008) and tokyo gore police (yoshihiro nishimura, 2008) have ushered in a new era of cyberpunk informed, gore-centric movies that have since been termed 'splatter-punk'. these splatter-punk movies share the same independent spirit of their precursors, substituting 8mm and 16mm film methods for cheap dv technology, retaining as much budget as possible for make-up, costume and practical effects. many of the effects in these films depict mutation and body alteration; splatter re-imaginings of the flesh-metal fusions of tetsuo, and the perverse, organic weaponry of tetsuo ii. similar to the splatstick horror of early sam raimi and peter jackson, the effects and transformations lean towards the ridiculous for comedic effect. one mutated character in tokyo gore police wields an oversized cannon made of contorted flesh, protruding from his crotch much like an erect penis, suggesting - in a very tongue-in-cheek manner - the blur between sex and violence that was posited by tsukamoto and fukui. yamaguchi and yamamoto's meatball machine is perhaps the closest to the japanese cyberpunk of old; parasitic aliens infect unsuspecting people, which promptly turns them into macabre man-machine teratoids that fight it out. in many ways, this 'splatter-punk' phase is also reminiscent of the special-effects race that occurred with american horror movies during the 1980s; cronenberg included. as practical effects became more advanced, a seemingly never-ending slew of films were produced, trying to out-shock one another with advancing exercises in gore. the same can be said here; the ante seems to be continually raised as each new release contorts and morphs the body in increasingly elaborate and grotesque ways. a reason for this is that many of these film's directors initially came from special effects backgrounds: tokyo gore police director yoshihiro nishimura for instance, has supervised the special effects for many modern gore productions including noboru iguchi's the machine girl and robo-geisha (2009). in fact, many of these films are made through fundoshi corps, a production company founded by nishimura, iguchi and film producer yukihiko yamaguchi, that specialise in cheaply produced, over-the-top movies of this ilk. it has proven to be a successful business model as their output is continually building a strong international fanbase, looking for perverse and outlandish content. the recurring touchstones of combining eroticism and perversion are also present. however, they for the most part forego subverted techno-fetishism in favour of contemporary v-cinema and pink film preoccupations. the machine girl for instance, uses typical imagery such as the japanese schoolgirl - a popular conceit in a lot of the nation's anime, manga and pornography industries - and takes it to new abject levels, connecting bullet spewing hardware to her severed limbs and even granting her the ability to grow weaponry from out of the small of her spine; skirt raised of course. unfortunately, it would appear that live-action japanese cyberpunk cinema has moved on from the daring, experimental underground from whence it came. the remnants of its ideas are now utilised in violent gore shockers that are bereft of the immediacy and philosophical potential of their progenitors. the movement, once an expression of attitude, concerns and frustration with the world, the way it's structured and the technology used - not just an exploration of the grey area between science fiction and horror - seems to have disappeared. however in 2009, shinya tsukamoto announced his return to the world of cyberpunk with a third tetsuo project. tetsuo: the bullet man is not only a return, but a new beginning for tsukamoto as it is his first english language film; an attempt to expose the demented world of tetsuo to a wider audience. it premiered at the 2009 venice film festival to mixed fanfare, prompting tsukamoto to continue working on it. subsequent showings - the 2010 tribeca festival for instance - have found greater critical favour, but a vital caveat still remains like the punk scene that it emulated, japanese cyberpunk was pertinent and inextricably linked to a specific time and place. more than a sub-genre, it tackled the anxieties of the period in ways that conventional expression would fall short. but now that we're in the technologically dependent twenty-first century - the post-human nightmare now a grim reality - can it still be relevant? references  endnotes [ 1 ]. sogo ishii's biographical details were adapted from an interview with the director conducted by tom mes for www.midnighteye.com (posted 06/15/2005) [ 2 ]. 1982/1983 would prove to be a crucial time in the international development of cyberpunk. this period saw the release of four highly influential texts: sogo ishii's burst city (1982), ridley scott's blade runner (1982), the initial publishing of katsuhiro otomo's akira manga series (1982-1990) and david cronenberg's videodrome (1983).

the human form consumed and destroyed at the hands of intervening science. despite death powder's aesthetic and thematic influence, it went by with little fanfare and was never seen outside of japan until years later. the subsequent, similar minded android of notre dame (kuramoto; 1988) fared slightly better, partly due to the infamy that surrounded the film series it was part of, a seven-film collection known as the guinea pig series; short exploitation features that focused on torture, murder and other destructive processes, designed to appear realistic and snuff-like [ 4 ]. android of notre dame failed to strike a chord with wider audiences and has since wallowed in cult obscurity along with its filmic brethren. however, this all changed as japanese cyberpunk began to creep into the international spotlight with the anime feature film adaptation of katsuhiro otomo's popular manga series, akira (1988). although this writing focuses mainly on live-action cyberpunk output, akira's arrival was so important and influential to the sub-genre that it needs to be acknowledged. akira achieved two things: first; it opened up and, almost single-handedly, popularised anime and manga for global audiences (especially in the uk and us) and second; it perpetuated the cyberpunk ethos on perhaps the largest scale to date - combining the neon-lit, high-technology/low-living metropolis of blade runner and neuromancer with body horror overtones. the film condensed the vast narrative of otomo's gargantuan, six-part magnum opus into a streamlined, two-hour feature directed by otomo himself. it is a milestone within japanese cyberpunk as it was the first of the sub-genre to not only have commercial success domestically, but also managed to find an audience overseas. set within the destitute overcrowding of futuristic neo tokyo, the story revolves around juvenile biker thugs and best friends kaneda and tetsuo. during a turf spat with a rival gang, tetsuo crashes but is mysteriously taken away by military and scientific officials. they experiment on him with chemically altering drugs, turning tetsuo into a psycho-kinetic demigod with uncontrollable power. he goes on a destructive rampage through the city to seek an audience with akira, a highly powerful entity that destroyed the old tokyo decades before. part of akira's success inevitably lies in its attention to detail and vaulting ambition. the budget was astronomical for an anime feature at the time - around 1,100,000,000 [ 5 ] - acquired through the partnership of several major japanese media companies including toho and bandai. it avoided the corner cutting of anime projects in the past, producing hundreds of thousands of animation cells to create fluid motion - particularly in its many action set-pieces - and capture nuances that would've otherwise not existed. otomo also went to the trouble of doing lip-synched sound recording; a first for anime, resulting in extremely high and rich production values. the film set box office records for an anime in japan during its summer 1988 release, grossing over 6,300,000,000 [ 6 ]. internationally, it got a limited theatrical run in america and the united kingdom soon after - sowing the seeds for the immense western cult fanbase that it enjoys to this day - but failed to get home video distribution until the early nineties. themes of mutation, modernity and social unrest are rife. kaneda and tetsuo's biker gang are like a revved up version of the delinquents seen in ishii's crazy thunder road and burst city, while tetsuo's esp and subsequent transformation sets the film firmly in cronenberg's body horror territory. his eventual fusion with metal - resulting in a horrific man-machine hybrid that sees tetsuo become the master of a newly formed universe - not only is evocative of the cyberpunk notion of technology corrupting the human form (in this case literally) but also serves as an important visual precursor to the movement's next breakthrough, live-action work. often revered as the definitive example of extreme japanese cyberpunk and a vital cornerstone in the rebuilding of contemporary japanese cinema, tetsuo: the iron man was a baffling international success story, prompting many a sceptic on japan's future cinematic involvement to turn their attention eastward. barely over an hour in length, tetsuo was a breath of fresh air; a no-holds-barred sensory assault that gave japanese cinema a major image renovation and launched the career of its director, shinya tsukamoto, who has gone on to become one of the country's most respected and treasured auteurs. during its unprecedented and lengthy tour of international film festivals, tetsuo not only pointed towards exciting new possibilities for contemporary japanese cinema but was able to fit 'snugly into a pantheon of genre works that included ridley scott's blade runner, james cameron's the terminator, david lynch's eraserhead and the work of david cronenberg, sam raimi and clive barker'[ 7 ], which no doubt broadened its appeal. its use of kinetic cinematography, rapid-fire editing and diy, zero-budget special effects served as an invitation; a call to arms if you will, for independent filmmakers everywhere to produce unique and challenging cinema. however, the majority of the film's innovative style is, for the most part, lifted from elsewhere, promoting the fusion of a variety of influences including the hyperactive camerawork of ishii's burst city; the body horror of cronenberg's videodrome (1983) and the fly (1986); the biomechanical perversions of artist h.r. giger; the literature of j.g. ballard - particularly crash (1973) - and the stop-motion animation of jan svankmayer. there is also a sense of strange nostalgia for the old kaiju (monster) movies and television serials that tsukamoto watched when growing up in a tokyo experiencing post-war re-construction as well as major expansion and modernising in preparation for the japan hosting of the 1964 olympic games. like ishii, tsukamoto's early development stemmed from making 8mm films as a teenager during the 1970s, using his younger brother and friends as cast and crew members. as he reached adulthood, tsukamoto abandoned filmmaking and turned his attention increasingly towards the stage, forming a theatre troupe with like minded university students and directing plays [ 8 ]. one of the plays that tsukamoto wrote would subsequently be adapted into a film; the adventure of denchu kozo (1987) with the assistance of his theatre cohorts - christened 'kaiju theatre'. it was this same group that also made tetsuo, along with a revolving-door line-up of other helpers, most notably fellow filmmaker shozin fukui who would go to make his own cyberpunk features during the nineties. tetsuo's chief concern is the impact of technology on society and subsequently - and more specifically - the human form. tsukamoto suggests that technology is a disease, bursting forth unannounced and unexplained as evidenced in the salaryman's transformation - simultaneously reminiscent of cronenberg's the fly and otomo's akira - where a shard of metal lodged in the protagonist's cheek is the starting point for further mutation. like seth brundle of the fly, the salaryman is both repulsed yet intrigued by what he is turning into and, coincidently, his evolution shares the namesake of the transforming character of akira: tetsuo; meaning 'iron man' or 'clear thinking/philosophical man'. tsukamoto embraces both interpretations of his film's title. on one hand is the literal transformation of flesh to iron and on the other, a philosophical enquiry on technology's consuming nature and the symbiosis between city and citizen. however, closer inspection reveals further concerns, as evidenced by steven t. brown, author of the groundbreaking tokyo cyberpunk: posthumanism in japanese visual culture, in which he says: 'the mixing of flesh and metal in tetsuo is not only intensely violent but also darkly erotomechanical and techno-fetishistic, evoking sadomasochistic sexual practices and pleasures, as well as fears of both male and female sexuality out of control'[ 9 ]. in this regard, tsukamoto gives horror and eroticism equal attention: the salaryman has a nightmare involving his girlfriend (played by kei fujiwara) sodomising him with a mechanical, snakelike appendage strapped to her crotch. this gender-reversal is not only representative of one of david cronenberg's favourite thematic stomping grounds, but also shares the canadian director's ballardian [ 10 ] allusions, hyper-masculinity and homoerotic undertones. when the film's antagonist, yatsu (meaning 'guy') - a metal fetishist (played by tsukamoto himself) suffering from the same man-machine affliction - arrives at the apartment, he turns up 'presenting flowers to the salaryman in a parody of courtship'[ 11 ] that ends with physical assimilation.  this mechanical eros continues when, in an early stage of his transformation, the salaryman's penis turns into a rapidly oscillating drill which he then uses on his girlfriend with graphic results. by the film's end, he does battle and fuses together with the metal fetishist; the result is a large tank-like monstrosity with the suggested goal of world domination. his newfound unrepressed nature effectively destroys his heterosexual relationship, only to start a new one with someone - another male - experiencing similar changes to their body. the film's metaphorical capacity is achieved primarily through its abstract and surrealist execution that bears similarities to luis buuel's un chien andalou (1929) - as noted by brown in tokyo cyberpunk (p.60-64) - and david lynch's eraserhead. the latter is a popular comparison, prompting many to refer to tetsuo as a japanese eraserhead. whilst both films share an allegiance to post-humanism and industrialised iconography, eraserhead takes a slower burning, atmospheric approach. tetsuo on the other hand, takes a startlingly aggressive stance from the outset; combining hand-held camerawork, rapid fire editing and a pummelling, industrial music score by composer chu ishikawa - who would serve as composer for future tsukamoto projects - to create a battering and invasive sensory assault. it was an ethos that would carry over into the next decade of underground filmmaking. after completing his second feature, the manga adaptation hiruko the goblin (1990), tsukamoto returned to the world of mutated scrap with a second tetsuo film. tetsuo ii: the body hammer (1992) serves more as a companion piece than as a straightforward sequel or remake. it is a new interpretation of the same basic premise - man-machine transformation - but played out on a larger scale. tomorowo taguchi reprises his role as a (different) salaryman. this time, he lives in a sterile, high-rise apartment with his wife and young son. his metamorphosis is triggered when his son is kidnapped by an underground faction of skinheads who want to harness the salaryman's cyber-kinetic powers so that they can augment their bodies into organic weaponry in order to bring about mass destruction. if the ethos of the first tetsuo was related to the fly, the second film perhaps bears more of a similarity to cronenberg's scanners (1981) as the salaryman comes to blows against his mutated brother (played by tsukamoto), the leader of the skinhead group. in doing so, body hammer moves away from the surreal macabre horror of its predecessor and more towards an action/science fiction movie template; although plenty of avant-garde trimmings still remain to bridge, connect and embellish ideas. as a result, tsukamoto operates within a somewhat more conventional and ultimately, more accessible narrative structure, and the inclusion of a larger budget means that he is able to fully realise the end-of-the-world scenario suggested in the closing moments of the first film. as per tsukamoto's wish, tokyo is razed to the ground. like the first film, body hammer blurs the distinction between form and content. it also re-imagines concepts that were given little attention the first time around; the metal fetishist's obsession with physical perfection as suggested by the photos of successful athletes that adorn his shack like abode is 'brought very much to the foreground in the shape of the skinhead cult, which consists of athletes, bodybuilders and boxers who push their training regimen to the extreme' [ 12 ] - a topic that would dominate tsukamoto's subsequent film project. it's a possible indictment of the obsessive, body culture phenomenon that came about in the 1980s that saw more and more people going to the gym and taking advantage of artificial enhancements such as plastic surgery; a time when there was a strong emphasis on physical perfection and beauty. the film also hints at the direction tsukamoto would start to take with future productions: the environmental focus has shifted ever so slightly from the decaying urban sprawl to the sterile functionality of the metropolis centre, and more of an emphasis has been placed on the relationship between the salaryman and his wife; a marriage torn apart by invasive elements. the catalyst for transformation this time is not from infection or a curse as suggested in the original, but from demonstrative rage. the prospect of the salaryman's son being killed by the skinheads provokes the first instance of transformation, which occurs again when his wife is kidnapped, causing multiple gun-barrels to erupt from his chest and limbs. rage would go on to transform tsukamoto's protagonists in future films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998), albeit figuratively instead of literally. when mental anguish exceeds physical pain: pinocchio 946 and rubber's lover in the wake of tetsuo's startling domestic and international success, one would think that it would have acted as a catalyst to trigger a wave of similarly styled films. in retrospect, this wasn't the case as very few filmmakers decided to follow the path forged by tsukamoto's breakthrough work. however, former colleague shozin fukui was one of the few to accept the challenge. like tsukamoto and izumiya before him, fukui is a disciple of sogo ishii's breakthrough independent filmmaking during the late seventies as well as the music that inspired it. born in 1961, and upon moving to tokyo in the early eighties, fukui quickly became infatuated with the burgeoning underground punk music scene and set about forming his own band with friends. these same friends would serve as fukui's cast and crew on early forays into filmmaking such as metal days (1986) and the short films gerorisuto (1986) and caterpillar (1988) [ 13 ]. after serving as assistant director to both tsukamoto and ishii - on tetsuo: the iron man and the short film the master of shiatsu (shiatsu oja, 1989) respectively - fukui started to write and direct his own feature films. his first was pinocchio 964 (1991), and while it did not share the same philosophical leanings that tetsuo did two years before, it was an effective manifesto for fukui's thematic preoccupations nonetheless; how technological augmentation impacts on the fragile and potentially volatile nature of the human mind. the story focuses on the titular protagonist, a brainwashed individual who has been scientifically modified to operate as a sex slave. upon being thrown away by his sexually demanding female owners, pinocchio wonders the streets of present-day tokyo where he meets himiko, a fellow destitute. she takes pinocchio under her wing whereby he begins to fall in love with her, prompting the return of previously erased memories. when pinocchio realises what has happened to him and knows who's responsible, he plans revenge. meanwhile, the corporation in question organise a search party to reclaim their missing product. pinocchio 964 is frequently compared to tetsuo by cyberpunk enthusiasts and academics alike. both films represent the feature length debut of fukui and tsukamoto respectively and both films exhibit a similarly energetic and manic execution. it can be argued that fukui's style is indebted to tsukamoto due to his serving as assistant director for a period of tetsuo's filming. fukui's previous short, caterpillar - made at around the same time as tetsuo - features similar techniques including hyperactive, hand-held camerawork and stop-motion animation as well as similar imagery: mounds of scrap, ubiquitous urban living and flesh merged with machinery. however, there are some major differences. the most apparent is inherent in the film's mise en scene: pinocchio 964 is in colour (except for its opening sequence) whereas tetsuo is black and white - though its sequel was in colour. thematically, unlike tsukamoto's notion of technology as an organic, mutating disease, fukui's film depicts the body transformed as the direct result of man-made augmentation similar to early cronenberg - shivers (1975) and rabid (1977) for example - as well as mary shelley's frankenstein (1818). like the monster in shelley's seminal work, pinocchio is at first oblivious to his condition, but time spent in the real world causes him to realise his artificial existence and he seeks revenge against his creator. however, unlike frankenstein's monster, pinocchio was not constructed from scratch; he is his namesake in reverse - a human turned product through neuro tampering and memory wiping. fukui seems to suggest that modernity is programming the populous to concern themselves with nothing but sex; a sentiment that's readily apparent in the media and advertising industries. it could be argued then, that pinocchio 964 is the more precise cyberpunk text, offering a speculative stance on potential future technologies i.e. altered living through cybernetic assistance. as suggested in tetsuo, these technological changes have a perverse impact on sex; pinocchio is compelled to suckle on himiko's breasts in a brain-damaged, baby like stupor - not knowing any better - whereas the salaryman's girlfriend is enticed and drawn to ride her lover's newly developed drill-penis. the conclusion of pinocchio 964 sees further transformation beyond the esoteric boundaries as previously established. like the salaryman and metal fetishist, pinocchio and himiko - both of whom are victims of the corporation's scientific dalliances - merge together in a manner and style reminiscent of peter jackson's first lo-fi feature bad taste (1987), suggesting the start of a new, technologically altered meta-race in keeping with cronenberg's corporeal philosophy of the new flesh [ 14 ]. thanks to tetsuo's worldwide success - along with other newly emerging work like takashi kitano's gritty police caper violent cop (1989) - pinocchio 964 enjoyed a modicum of cult success as international demand for strange and ultra-violent japanese cinema began to increase. film companies such as toho started to cater to this newfound interest by introducing direct-to-video distribution lines that specialised in outputting low-budget, sensationalist material. one such entry was tomoo haraguchi's specifically titled mikadroid: robokill beneath disco club layla (1991), a cyber/steampunk horror about a buried, technologically augmented, super-soldier - built by japanese scientists during the second world war - being re-activated and going on a murderous rampage. largely unheard of, the film is perhaps most notable for featuring a (brief) acting turn from a then little-known kiyoshi kurosawa, who would later go on to direct internationally renowned works such as cure (1997), pulse (2001) and tokyo sonata (2008). both pinocchio 964 and mikadroid would be overshadowed by tsukamoto's higher budget and higher profile tetsuo sequel, which arrived the following year. in the meantime, fukui was already planning the next project; one that would take almost five years to gestate and execute. the result was rubber's lover (1996), fukui's second and, at present, last feature; a subterranean post-industrial nightmare of human experimentation and bodily destruction. a clandestine group of scientists experiment on human guinea pigs pinched from the street to unlock psychic powers. this is achieved through a combination of computer interfaces, sensory depravation and regular injections of ether, usually resulting in the subject dying a gruesome and explosive death. often interpreted as a lose prequel to pinocchio v946, rubber's lover, despite similarities to its predecessor also represents a distinct contrast. the most readily apparent differences are the film's use of monochrome photography - a decision made by fukui when he disliked the look of the sm flavoured costumes when filmed in colour - and the film's comparatively subdued pace; favouring atmosphere over propulsion. however, his pre-established tropes still remain: invasive technologies; bizarre sexual practices as a by-product of such technologies; retrograde/outdated equipment; mutation; and a fetish for bodily fluids - pus, blood, vomit etc. like tetsuo, rubber's lover depicts the establishment of a new world order through corporeal and technologically informed symbiosis: the biological co-existence between flesh and metal and the destruction of mental and physical barriers respectively. rubber's lover also takes great pleasure in distorting the boundaries and exploring the grey area between sex and violence; much more so than pinocchio 964. one scene sees a frenzied character tearing the flesh off another, mid-coitus on a hospital bed whilst a corporate scumbag laughs in the corner of the room. the researcher's successful test subject, motomiya - a former member of the team who has since become addicted to ether - is made to wear a strange, rubber sm bodysuit, further augmented with makeshift technological add-ons of monitors, wires and outdated gizmos. their nurse's rotating, ether injector is especially phallic and is used on their subjects rectally for immediate effect, suggesting a notion of perversion that transcends sex and violence and into the realms of science and technology. rubber's lover's perverted view on science not only echoes some of the imagery and themes from izumiya's death powder (and to a lesser extent, haraguchi's mikadroid) but the real-life, deranged human experiments carried out by the japanese military's infamous unit 731 on chinese prisoners of war during the 1930s and 40s [ 15 ]; depicting a doomsday scenario that sees the human race tear itself apart in the pursuit of scientific understanding and technological superiority. motomiya's ether addiction is caused by one of his research colleagues. the same colleague later kidnaps and rapes a representative of the project's benefactor sent in to oversee its shutdown. she is also subjugated to d.d.d (direct digital drive), the apparatus used in the project's testing. fukui's fascination over the frailty and destructibility of the human mind comes to fruition as motomiya quickly turns mad; burdened with newly unlocked psychic powers that he can't control. like pinocchio 964, rubber's lover examines the mental transformation that invasive technologies incur on the human condition. this is in stark contrast to tsukamoto's tetsuo films that focus primarily on the physical transformation caused by the same factors, which perhaps serves as the key difference between their otherwise similar films within the sub-genre. ishii's second revolution: electric dragon 80,000v  by the mid-to-late 1990s, japanese cyberpunk cinema was starting to wane; having been overtaken by the blood-stained yakuza films of kitano and miike in terms of international prominence, who would in turn be overshadowed by the new wave of supernatural, j-horror films that emerged at the turn of the century including hideo nakata's the ring (1998) and ring 2 (1999). fukui's rubber's lover was the last underground cyberpunk film of the nineties and arguably the last ever. upon its completion and after getting a limited video release, fukui put filmmaking on hold to join a video production company; he worked there for the best part of ten years. tsukamoto had moved on also, continuing his exploration of the symbiosis between city and citizen with a matured pallet. his films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998) eschew virtually all of the science fiction and horror imagery that had characterised his work previously. cyberpunk was kept alive within japan's anime and manga industries but it wasn't until the turn of the millennium when it returned to cinema. the year 2001 saw the release of two films that would give the genre a new lease of life. mamoru oshii made avalon, a live-action japanese/polish co-production about an addictive virtual simulation game. it was oshii's first film since his internationally successful anime feature film adaptation of ghost in the shell (1995) - he would go on to direct the sequel; ghost in the shell 2: innocence (2004). shot in poland with polish actors and a japanese crew, avalon's themes of virtual reality places it in the same territory as a lot of american produced cyberpunk that surfaced during the nineties: the lawnmower man (1992), strange days (1995), the thirteenth floor (1999), the matrix (1999) and cronenberg's similarly concerned existenz (1999) for example. it was also redolent of many similarly themed anime releases - both theatrical and televised - that emerged during the same decade as the real-life phenomenon of the internet started to make the world seem even smaller; oshii's own adaptation of ghost in the shell and ryutaro nakamura's serial experiments: lain (1998) series were particularly indicative of these technological and cultural changes. another notable example and precursor to much of the vr-centric work that would appear in the 1990s is the four-part anime series megazone 23 (1985-1989), which explores the idea of a post-apocalyptic tokyo existing as a futuristic virtual simulation. the second film from 2001 was sogo ishii's electric dragon 80,000v, which not only served as ishii's return to punk cinema after a decade of more meditative output but, like burst city, spearheaded a new generation of like minded filmmaking that has evolved japanese cyberpunk into a new and strange beast. as with the sensory assault cinema favoured by tsukamoto and fukui, electric dragon is a film that is experienced rather than watched, stimulating the most primitive parts of the brain in a tsunami of sound and image. the premise is simple enough; a young boy contracts the ability to channel and wield electricity, acquired from a childhood accident whilst climbing some power lines - an ability further enhanced by receiving multiple jolts of electro-shock therapy for violent behaviour. now an adult with megawatts of power coursing through him, dragon eye morrison is a professional reptile investigator, searching alleyways for lost lizards. equilibrium is disturbed by the arrival of thunderbolt buddha, a tv repair man turned vigilante whose electro-conductive talents are the result of mechanical wizardry. the two meet and battle for supremacy on tokyo's rooftops. as was the case with burst city, electric dragon leans less towards the cyber and more towards the punk aspect of the sub-genre, with ishii following the train of thought he employed with his music videos and concert films during the 1980s. the film's title also makes reference to the old days, partly derived from 'live spot 20,000v', the concert venue that plays a pivotal role in burst city and one of ishii's early shorts, the solitude of one divided by 880,000 (1978). electric dragon is less about the nightmare and more about anarchic expression at odds with the post-modern universe. however, some cyber signifiers do remain; the oppressive tokyo setting realised in stark monochrome; the fetishist attitude towards power lines, aerials, ventilation ducts and other ubiquitous technological appliances; the hyperactive and frequently expressionist delivery; its low-budget, guerrilla-like execution and, like tetsuo, the concept of two characters augmented through technology, giving them powers that they can't fully control, coming to blows. dragon eye morrison has to clamp himself to a metal bed frame at night whilst thunderbolt buddha's penchants for electronic devices to assist in his nocturnal excursions sometimes get the better of him as he fights for control of his own body. the psycho-sexual themes that dominated past japanese cyberpunk have been replaced with an equally primal notion of animal magnetism. morrison's electric power is derived from the 'dragon' that's embedded in all living things. his rage unlocks the strength of the dragon, meaning that he can harness more energy by sucking it out of household appliances or by creating a non-melodic racket on his electric guitar; a high-voltage cacophony of noise and expression announcing that ishii's punk spirit is still alive and well. indeed, lead actor tadanobu asano occasionally guests in ishii's industrial noise-punk ensemble mach 1.67, which provided the film's propulsive soundtrack. the film would later be used to accompany the group's live shows, a strategy ishii pioneered back in 1983 when he made the short film asia strikes back - a little-known cyberpunk piece that provided the template for shozin fukui's preferred set-up of underground experiments gone haywire - to back up the album and tour of the short-lived punk supergroup the bacillus army. similar to tsukamoto's tetsuo, dialogue in electric dragon 80,000v is minimal thus the narrative is powered mainly by image and follows a similar template; the protagonist is seen acquiring his power; the antagonist then challenges the protagonist to combat and the final act sees them clash. all of this is wrapped up in a high energy, fatless sixty-minute package. ishii's film is not only is a throwback to the eighties cyberpunk manifesto but reminds us that rather than being characterised by heavy, science fiction concepts, as was the case in the west, it was defined by its independence, attitude and the will to create something out of nothing. the rise of 'splatter-punk' in the years following electric dragon 80,000v, a new wave of low-budget horror/science fiction began to surface largely thanks to increased dvd distribution channels, cheaper production techniques and the ever increasing reach of the internet. films like hellevator: the bottled fools (hiroki yamaguchi, 2004), meatball machine (yudai yamaguchi  junichi yamamoto, 2005), the machine girl (noboru iguchi, 2008) and tokyo gore police (yoshihiro nishimura, 2008) have ushered in a new era of cyberpunk informed, gore-centric movies that have since been termed 'splatter-punk'. these splatter-punk movies share the same independent spirit of their precursors, substituting 8mm and 16mm film methods for cheap dv technology, retaining as much budget as possible for make-up, costume and practical effects. many of the effects in these films depict mutation and body alteration; splatter re-imaginings of the flesh-metal fusions of tetsuo, and the perverse, organic weaponry of tetsuo ii. similar to the splatstick horror of early sam raimi and peter jackson, the effects and transformations lean towards the ridiculous for comedic effect. one mutated character in tokyo gore police wields an oversized cannon made of contorted flesh, protruding from his crotch much like an erect penis, suggesting - in a very tongue-in-cheek manner - the blur between sex and violence that was posited by tsukamoto and fukui. yamaguchi and yamamoto's meatball machine is perhaps the closest to the japanese cyberpunk of old; parasitic aliens infect unsuspecting people, which promptly turns them into macabre man-machine teratoids that fight it out. in many ways, this 'splatter-punk' phase is also reminiscent of the special-effects race that occurred with american horror movies during the 1980s; cronenberg included. as practical effects became more advanced, a seemingly never-ending slew of films were produced, trying to out-shock one another with advancing exercises in gore. the same can be said here; the ante seems to be continually raised as each new release contorts and morphs the body in increasingly elaborate and grotesque ways. a reason for this is that many of these film's directors initially came from special effects backgrounds: tokyo gore police director yoshihiro nishimura for instance, has supervised the special effects for many modern gore productions including noboru iguchi's the machine girl and robo-geisha (2009). in fact, many of these films are made through fundoshi corps, a production company founded by nishimura, iguchi and film producer yukihiko yamaguchi, that specialise in cheaply produced, over-the-top movies of this ilk. it has proven to be a successful business model as their output is continually building a strong international fanbase, looking for perverse and outlandish content. the recurring touchstones of combining eroticism and perversion are also present. however, they for the most part forego subverted techno-fetishism in favour of contemporary v-cinema and pink film preoccupations. the machine girl for instance, uses typical imagery such as the japanese schoolgirl - a popular conceit in a lot of the nation's anime, manga and pornography industries - and takes it to new abject levels, connecting bullet spewing hardware to her severed limbs and even granting her the ability to grow weaponry from out of the small of her spine; skirt raised of course. unfortunately, it would appear that live-action japanese cyberpunk cinema has moved on from the daring, experimental underground from whence it came. the remnants of its ideas are now utilised in violent gore shockers that are bereft of the immediacy and philosophical potential of their progenitors. the movement, once an expression of attitude, concerns and frustration with the world, the way it's structured and the technology used - not just an exploration of the grey area between science fiction and horror - seems to have disappeared. however in 2009, shinya tsukamoto announced his return to the world of cyberpunk with a third tetsuo project. tetsuo: the bullet man is not only a return, but a new beginning for tsukamoto as it is his first english language film; an attempt to expose the demented world of tetsuo to a wider audience. it premiered at the 2009 venice film festival to mixed fanfare, prompting tsukamoto to continue working on it. subsequent showings - the 2010 tribeca festival for instance - have found greater critical favour, but a vital caveat still remains like the punk scene that it emulated, japanese cyberpunk was pertinent and inextricably linked to a specific time and place. more than a sub-genre, it tackled the anxieties of the period in ways that conventional expression would fall short. but now that we're in the technologically dependent twenty-first century - the post-human nightmare now a grim reality - can it still be relevant? references  endnotes [ 1 ]. sogo ishii's biographical details were adapted from an interview with the director conducted by tom mes for www.midnighteye.com (posted 06/15/2005) [ 2 ]. 1982/1983 would prove to be a crucial time in the international development of cyberpunk. this period saw the release of four highly influential texts: sogo ishii's burst city (1982), ridley scott's blade runner (1982), the initial publishing of katsuhiro otomo's akira manga series (1982-1990) and david cronenberg's videodrome (1983).

the result is a large tank-like monstrosity with the suggested goal of world domination. his newfound unrepressed nature effectively destroys his heterosexual relationship, only to start a new one with someone - another male - experiencing similar changes to their body. the film's metaphorical capacity is achieved primarily through its abstract and surrealist execution that bears similarities to luis buuel's un chien andalou (1929) - as noted by brown in tokyo cyberpunk (p.60-64) - and david lynch's eraserhead. the latter is a popular comparison, prompting many to refer to tetsuo as a japanese eraserhead. whilst both films share an allegiance to post-humanism and industrialised iconography, eraserhead takes a slower burning, atmospheric approach. tetsuo on the other hand, takes a startlingly aggressive stance from the outset; combining hand-held camerawork, rapid fire editing and a pummelling, industrial music score by composer chu ishikawa - who would serve as composer for future tsukamoto projects - to create a battering and invasive sensory assault. it was an ethos that would carry over into the next decade of underground filmmaking. after completing his second feature, the manga adaptation hiruko the goblin (1990), tsukamoto returned to the world of mutated scrap with a second tetsuo film. tetsuo ii: the body hammer (1992) serves more as a companion piece than as a straightforward sequel or remake. it is a new interpretation of the same basic premise - man-machine transformation - but played out on a larger scale. tomorowo taguchi reprises his role as a (different) salaryman. this time, he lives in a sterile, high-rise apartment with his wife and young son. his metamorphosis is triggered when his son is kidnapped by an underground faction of skinheads who want to harness the salaryman's cyber-kinetic powers so that they can augment their bodies into organic weaponry in order to bring about mass destruction. if the ethos of the first tetsuo was related to the fly, the second film perhaps bears more of a similarity to cronenberg's scanners (1981) as the salaryman comes to blows against his mutated brother (played by tsukamoto), the leader of the skinhead group. in doing so, body hammer moves away from the surreal macabre horror of its predecessor and more towards an action/science fiction movie template; although plenty of avant-garde trimmings still remain to bridge, connect and embellish ideas. as a result, tsukamoto operates within a somewhat more conventional and ultimately, more accessible narrative structure, and the inclusion of a larger budget means that he is able to fully realise the end-of-the-world scenario suggested in the closing moments of the first film. as per tsukamoto's wish, tokyo is razed to the ground. like the first film, body hammer blurs the distinction between form and content. it also re-imagines concepts that were given little attention the first time around; the metal fetishist's obsession with physical perfection as suggested by the photos of successful athletes that adorn his shack like abode is 'brought very much to the foreground in the shape of the skinhead cult, which consists of athletes, bodybuilders and boxers who push their training regimen to the extreme' [ 12 ] - a topic that would dominate tsukamoto's subsequent film project. it's a possible indictment of the obsessive, body culture phenomenon that came about in the 1980s that saw more and more people going to the gym and taking advantage of artificial enhancements such as plastic surgery; a time when there was a strong emphasis on physical perfection and beauty. the film also hints at the direction tsukamoto would start to take with future productions: the environmental focus has shifted ever so slightly from the decaying urban sprawl to the sterile functionality of the metropolis centre, and more of an emphasis has been placed on the relationship between the salaryman and his wife; a marriage torn apart by invasive elements. the catalyst for transformation this time is not from infection or a curse as suggested in the original, but from demonstrative rage. the prospect of the salaryman's son being killed by the skinheads provokes the first instance of transformation, which occurs again when his wife is kidnapped, causing multiple gun-barrels to erupt from his chest and limbs. rage would go on to transform tsukamoto's protagonists in future films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998), albeit figuratively instead of literally. in the wake of tetsuo's startling domestic and international success, one would think that it would have acted as a catalyst to trigger a wave of similarly styled films. in retrospect, this wasn't the case as very few filmmakers decided to follow the path forged by tsukamoto's breakthrough work. however, former colleague shozin fukui was one of the few to accept the challenge. like tsukamoto and izumiya before him, fukui is a disciple of sogo ishii's breakthrough independent filmmaking during the late seventies as well as the music that inspired it. born in 1961, and upon moving to tokyo in the early eighties, fukui quickly became infatuated with the burgeoning underground punk music scene and set about forming his own band with friends. these same friends would serve as fukui's cast and crew on early forays into filmmaking such as metal days (1986) and the short films gerorisuto (1986) and caterpillar (1988) [ 13 ]. after serving as assistant director to both tsukamoto and ishii - on tetsuo: the iron man and the short film the master of shiatsu (shiatsu oja, 1989) respectively - fukui started to write and direct his own feature films. his first was pinocchio 964 (1991), and while it did not share the same philosophical leanings that tetsuo did two years before, it was an effective manifesto for fukui's thematic preoccupations nonetheless; how technological augmentation impacts on the fragile and potentially volatile nature of the human mind. the story focuses on the titular protagonist, a brainwashed individual who has been scientifically modified to operate as a sex slave. upon being thrown away by his sexually demanding female owners, pinocchio wonders the streets of present-day tokyo where he meets himiko, a fellow destitute. she takes pinocchio under her wing whereby he begins to fall in love with her, prompting the return of previously erased memories. when pinocchio realises what has happened to him and knows who's responsible, he plans revenge. meanwhile, the corporation in question organise a search party to reclaim their missing product. pinocchio 964 is frequently compared to tetsuo by cyberpunk enthusiasts and academics alike. both films represent the feature length debut of fukui and tsukamoto respectively and both films exhibit a similarly energetic and manic execution. it can be argued that fukui's style is indebted to tsukamoto due to his serving as assistant director for a period of tetsuo's filming. fukui's previous short, caterpillar - made at around the same time as tetsuo - features similar techniques including hyperactive, hand-held camerawork and stop-motion animation as well as similar imagery: mounds of scrap, ubiquitous urban living and flesh merged with machinery. however, there are some major differences. the most apparent is inherent in the film's mise en scene: pinocchio 964 is in colour (except for its opening sequence) whereas tetsuo is black and white - though its sequel was in colour. thematically, unlike tsukamoto's notion of technology as an organic, mutating disease, fukui's film depicts the body transformed as the direct result of man-made augmentation similar to early cronenberg - shivers (1975) and rabid (1977) for example - as well as mary shelley's frankenstein (1818). like the monster in shelley's seminal work, pinocchio is at first oblivious to his condition, but time spent in the real world causes him to realise his artificial existence and he seeks revenge against his creator. however, unlike frankenstein's monster, pinocchio was not constructed from scratch; he is his namesake in reverse - a human turned product through neuro tampering and memory wiping. fukui seems to suggest that modernity is programming the populous to concern themselves with nothing but sex; a sentiment that's readily apparent in the media and advertising industries. it could be argued then, that pinocchio 964 is the more precise cyberpunk text, offering a speculative stance on potential future technologies i.e. altered living through cybernetic assistance. as suggested in tetsuo, these technological changes have a perverse impact on sex; pinocchio is compelled to suckle on himiko's breasts in a brain-damaged, baby like stupor - not knowing any better - whereas the salaryman's girlfriend is enticed and drawn to ride her lover's newly developed drill-penis. the conclusion of pinocchio 964 sees further transformation beyond the esoteric boundaries as previously established. like the salaryman and metal fetishist, pinocchio and himiko - both of whom are victims of the corporation's scientific dalliances - merge together in a manner and style reminiscent of peter jackson's first lo-fi feature bad taste (1987), suggesting the start of a new, technologically altered meta-race in keeping with cronenberg's corporeal philosophy of the new flesh [ 14 ].  thanks to tetsuo's worldwide success - along with other newly emerging work like takashi kitano's gritty police caper violent cop (1989) - pinocchio 964 enjoyed a modicum of cult success as international demand for strange and ultra-violent japanese cinema began to increase. film companies such as toho started to cater to this newfound interest by introducing direct-to-video distribution lines that specialised in outputting low-budget, sensationalist material. one such entry was tomoo haraguchi's specifically titled mikadroid: robokill beneath disco club layla (1991), a cyber/steampunk horror about a buried, technologically augmented, super-soldier - built by japanese scientists during the second world war - being re-activated and going on a murderous rampage. largely unheard of, the film is perhaps most notable for featuring a (brief) acting turn from a then little-known kiyoshi kurosawa, who would later go on to direct internationally renowned works such as cure (1997), pulse (2001) and tokyo sonata (2008). both pinocchio 964 and mikadroid would be overshadowed by tsukamoto's higher budget and higher profile tetsuo sequel, which arrived the following year. in the meantime, fukui was already planning the next project; one that would take almost five years to gestate and execute. the result was rubber's lover (1996), fukui's second and, at present, last feature; a subterranean post-industrial nightmare of human experimentation and bodily destruction. a clandestine group of scientists experiment on human guinea pigs pinched from the street to unlock psychic powers. this is achieved through a combination of computer interfaces, sensory depravation and regular injections of ether, usually resulting in the subject dying a gruesome and explosive death. often interpreted as a lose prequel to pinocchio v946, rubber's lover, despite similarities to its predecessor also represents a distinct contrast. the most readily apparent differences are the film's use of monochrome photography - a decision made by fukui when he disliked the look of the sm flavoured costumes when filmed in colour - and the film's comparatively subdued pace; favouring atmosphere over propulsion. however, his pre-established tropes still remain: invasive technologies; bizarre sexual practices as a by-product of such technologies; retrograde/outdated equipment; mutation; and a fetish for bodily fluids - pus, blood, vomit etc. like tetsuo, rubber's lover depicts the establishment of a new world order through corporeal and technologically informed symbiosis: the biological co-existence between flesh and metal and the destruction of mental and physical barriers respectively. rubber's lover also takes great pleasure in distorting the boundaries and exploring the grey area between sex and violence; much more so than pinocchio 964. one scene sees a frenzied character tearing the flesh off another, mid-coitus on a hospital bed whilst a corporate scumbag laughs in the corner of the room. the researcher's successful test subject, motomiya - a former member of the team who has since become addicted to ether - is made to wear a strange, rubber sm bodysuit, further augmented with makeshift technological add-ons of monitors, wires and outdated gizmos. their nurse's rotating, ether injector is especially phallic and is used on their subjects rectally for immediate effect, suggesting a notion of perversion that transcends sex and violence and into the realms of science and technology. rubber's lover's perverted view on science not only echoes some of the imagery and themes from izumiya's death powder (and to a lesser extent, haraguchi's mikadroid) but the real-life, deranged human experiments carried out by the japanese military's infamous unit 731 on chinese prisoners of war during the 1930s and 40s [ 15 ]; depicting a doomsday scenario that sees the human race tear itself apart in the pursuit of scientific understanding and technological superiority. motomiya's ether addiction is caused by one of his research colleagues. the same colleague later kidnaps and rapes a representative of the project's benefactor sent in to oversee its shutdown. she is also subjugated to d.d.d (direct digital drive), the apparatus used in the project's testing. fukui's fascination over the frailty and destructibility of the human mind comes to fruition as motomiya quickly turns mad; burdened with newly unlocked psychic powers that he can't control. like pinocchio 964, rubber's lover examines the mental transformation that invasive technologies incur on the human condition. this is in stark contrast to tsukamoto's tetsuo films that focus primarily on the physical transformation caused by the same factors, which perhaps serves as the key difference between their otherwise similar films within the sub-genre. ishii's second revolution: electric dragon 80,000v  by the mid-to-late 1990s, japanese cyberpunk cinema was starting to wane; having been overtaken by the blood-stained yakuza films of kitano and miike in terms of international prominence, who would in turn be overshadowed by the new wave of supernatural, j-horror films that emerged at the turn of the century including hideo nakata's the ring (1998) and ring 2 (1999). fukui's rubber's lover was the last underground cyberpunk film of the nineties and arguably the last ever. upon its completion and after getting a limited video release, fukui put filmmaking on hold to join a video production company; he worked there for the best part of ten years. tsukamoto had moved on also, continuing his exploration of the symbiosis between city and citizen with a matured pallet. his films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998) eschew virtually all of the science fiction and horror imagery that had characterised his work previously. cyberpunk was kept alive within japan's anime and manga industries but it wasn't until the turn of the millennium when it returned to cinema. the year 2001 saw the release of two films that would give the genre a new lease of life. mamoru oshii made avalon, a live-action japanese/polish co-production about an addictive virtual simulation game. it was oshii's first film since his internationally successful anime feature film adaptation of ghost in the shell (1995) - he would go on to direct the sequel; ghost in the shell 2: innocence (2004). shot in poland with polish actors and a japanese crew, avalon's themes of virtual reality places it in the same territory as a lot of american produced cyberpunk that surfaced during the nineties: the lawnmower man (1992), strange days (1995), the thirteenth floor (1999), the matrix (1999) and cronenberg's similarly concerned existenz (1999) for example. it was also redolent of many similarly themed anime releases - both theatrical and televised - that emerged during the same decade as the real-life phenomenon of the internet started to make the world seem even smaller; oshii's own adaptation of ghost in the shell and ryutaro nakamura's serial experiments: lain (1998) series were particularly indicative of these technological and cultural changes. another notable example and precursor to much of the vr-centric work that would appear in the 1990s is the four-part anime series megazone 23 (1985-1989), which explores the idea of a post-apocalyptic tokyo existing as a futuristic virtual simulation. the second film from 2001 was sogo ishii's electric dragon 80,000v, which not only served as ishii's return to punk cinema after a decade of more meditative output but, like burst city, spearheaded a new generation of like minded filmmaking that has evolved japanese cyberpunk into a new and strange beast. as with the sensory assault cinema favoured by tsukamoto and fukui, electric dragon is a film that is experienced rather than watched, stimulating the most primitive parts of the brain in a tsunami of sound and image. the premise is simple enough; a young boy contracts the ability to channel and wield electricity, acquired from a childhood accident whilst climbing some power lines - an ability further enhanced by receiving multiple jolts of electro-shock therapy for violent behaviour. now an adult with megawatts of power coursing through him, dragon eye morrison is a professional reptile investigator, searching alleyways for lost lizards. equilibrium is disturbed by the arrival of thunderbolt buddha, a tv repair man turned vigilante whose electro-conductive talents are the result of mechanical wizardry. the two meet and battle for supremacy on tokyo's rooftops. as was the case with burst city, electric dragon leans less towards the cyber and more towards the punk aspect of the sub-genre, with ishii following the train of thought he employed with his music videos and concert films during the 1980s. the film's title also makes reference to the old days, partly derived from 'live spot 20,000v', the concert venue that plays a pivotal role in burst city and one of ishii's early shorts, the solitude of one divided by 880,000 (1978). electric dragon is less about the nightmare and more about anarchic expression at odds with the post-modern universe. however, some cyber signifiers do remain; the oppressive tokyo setting realised in stark monochrome; the fetishist attitude towards power lines, aerials, ventilation ducts and other ubiquitous technological appliances; the hyperactive and frequently expressionist delivery; its low-budget, guerrilla-like execution and, like tetsuo, the concept of two characters augmented through technology, giving them powers that they can't fully control, coming to blows. dragon eye morrison has to clamp himself to a metal bed frame at night whilst thunderbolt buddha's penchants for electronic devices to assist in his nocturnal excursions sometimes get the better of him as he fights for control of his own body. the psycho-sexual themes that dominated past japanese cyberpunk have been replaced with an equally primal notion of animal magnetism. morrison's electric power is derived from the 'dragon' that's embedded in all living things. his rage unlocks the strength of the dragon, meaning that he can harness more energy by sucking it out of household appliances or by creating a non-melodic racket on his electric guitar; a high-voltage cacophony of noise and expression announcing that ishii's punk spirit is still alive and well. indeed, lead actor tadanobu asano occasionally guests in ishii's industrial noise-punk ensemble mach 1.67, which provided the film's propulsive soundtrack. the film would later be used to accompany the group's live shows, a strategy ishii pioneered back in 1983 when he made the short film asia strikes back - a little-known cyberpunk piece that provided the template for shozin fukui's preferred set-up of underground experiments gone haywire - to back up the album and tour of the short-lived punk supergroup the bacillus army. similar to tsukamoto's tetsuo, dialogue in electric dragon 80,000v is minimal thus the narrative is powered mainly by image and follows a similar template; the protagonist is seen acquiring his power; the antagonist then challenges the protagonist to combat and the final act sees them clash. all of this is wrapped up in a high energy, fatless sixty-minute package. ishii's film is not only is a throwback to the eighties cyberpunk manifesto but reminds us that rather than being characterised by heavy, science fiction concepts, as was the case in the west, it was defined by its independence, attitude and the will to create something out of nothing. the rise of 'splatter-punk' in the years following electric dragon 80,000v, a new wave of low-budget horror/science fiction began to surface largely thanks to increased dvd distribution channels, cheaper production techniques and the ever increasing reach of the internet. films like hellevator: the bottled fools (hiroki yamaguchi, 2004), meatball machine (yudai yamaguchi  junichi yamamoto, 2005), the machine girl (noboru iguchi, 2008) and tokyo gore police (yoshihiro nishimura, 2008) have ushered in a new era of cyberpunk informed, gore-centric movies that have since been termed 'splatter-punk'. these splatter-punk movies share the same independent spirit of their precursors, substituting 8mm and 16mm film methods for cheap dv technology, retaining as much budget as possible for make-up, costume and practical effects. many of the effects in these films depict mutation and body alteration; splatter re-imaginings of the flesh-metal fusions of tetsuo, and the perverse, organic weaponry of tetsuo ii. similar to the splatstick horror of early sam raimi and peter jackson, the effects and transformations lean towards the ridiculous for comedic effect. one mutated character in tokyo gore police wields an oversized cannon made of contorted flesh, protruding from his crotch much like an erect penis, suggesting - in a very tongue-in-cheek manner - the blur between sex and violence that was posited by tsukamoto and fukui. yamaguchi and yamamoto's meatball machine is perhaps the closest to the japanese cyberpunk of old; parasitic aliens infect unsuspecting people, which promptly turns them into macabre man-machine teratoids that fight it out. in many ways, this 'splatter-punk' phase is also reminiscent of the special-effects race that occurred with american horror movies during the 1980s; cronenberg included. as practical effects became more advanced, a seemingly never-ending slew of films were produced, trying to out-shock one another with advancing exercises in gore. the same can be said here; the ante seems to be continually raised as each new release contorts and morphs the body in increasingly elaborate and grotesque ways. a reason for this is that many of these film's directors initially came from special effects backgrounds: tokyo gore police director yoshihiro nishimura for instance, has supervised the special effects for many modern gore productions including noboru iguchi's the machine girl and robo-geisha (2009). in fact, many of these films are made through fundoshi corps, a production company founded by nishimura, iguchi and film producer yukihiko yamaguchi, that specialise in cheaply produced, over-the-top movies of this ilk. it has proven to be a successful business model as their output is continually building a strong international fanbase, looking for perverse and outlandish content. the recurring touchstones of combining eroticism and perversion are also present. however, they for the most part forego subverted techno-fetishism in favour of contemporary v-cinema and pink film preoccupations. the machine girl for instance, uses typical imagery such as the japanese schoolgirl - a popular conceit in a lot of the nation's anime, manga and pornography industries - and takes it to new abject levels, connecting bullet spewing hardware to her severed limbs and even granting her the ability to grow weaponry from out of the small of her spine; skirt raised of course. unfortunately, it would appear that live-action japanese cyberpunk cinema has moved on from the daring, experimental underground from whence it came. the remnants of its ideas are now utilised in violent gore shockers that are bereft of the immediacy and philosophical potential of their progenitors. the movement, once an expression of attitude, concerns and frustration with the world, the way it's structured and the technology used - not just an exploration of the grey area between science fiction and horror - seems to have disappeared. however in 2009, shinya tsukamoto announced his return to the world of cyberpunk with a third tetsuo project. tetsuo: the bullet man is not only a return, but a new beginning for tsukamoto as it is his first english language film; an attempt to expose the demented world of tetsuo to a wider audience. it premiered at the 2009 venice film festival to mixed fanfare, prompting tsukamoto to continue working on it. subsequent showings - the 2010 tribeca festival for instance - have found greater critical favour, but a vital caveat still remains like the punk scene that it emulated, japanese cyberpunk was pertinent and inextricably linked to a specific time and place. more than a sub-genre, it tackled the anxieties of the period in ways that conventional expression would fall short. but now that we're in the technologically dependent twenty-first century - the post-human nightmare now a grim reality - can it still be relevant? references  endnotes [ 1 ]. sogo ishii's biographical details were adapted from an interview with the director conducted by tom mes for www.midnighteye.com (posted 06/15/2005) [ 2 ]. 1982/1983 would prove to be a crucial time in the international development of cyberpunk. this period saw the release of four highly influential texts: sogo ishii's burst city (1982), ridley scott's blade runner (1982), the initial publishing of katsuhiro otomo's akira manga series (1982-1990) and david cronenberg's videodrome (1983).

burdened with newly unlocked psychic powers that he can't control. like pinocchio 964, rubber's lover examines the mental transformation that invasive technologies incur on the human condition. this is in stark contrast to tsukamoto's tetsuo films that focus primarily on the physical transformation caused by the same factors, which perhaps serves as the key difference between their otherwise similar films within the sub-genre. by the mid-to-late 1990s, japanese cyberpunk cinema was starting to wane; having been overtaken by the blood-stained yakuza films of kitano and miike in terms of international prominence, who would in turn be overshadowed by the new wave of supernatural, j-horror films that emerged at the turn of the century including hideo nakata's the ring (1998) and ring 2 (1999). fukui's rubber's lover was the last underground cyberpunk film of the nineties and arguably the last ever. upon its completion and after getting a limited video release, fukui put filmmaking on hold to join a video production company; he worked there for the best part of ten years. tsukamoto had moved on also, continuing his exploration of the symbiosis between city and citizen with a matured pallet. his films tokyo fist (1995) and bullet ballet (1998) eschew virtually all of the science fiction and horror imagery that had characterised his work previously. cyberpunk was kept alive within japan's anime and manga industries but it wasn't until the turn of the millennium when it returned to cinema. the year 2001 saw the release of two films that would give the genre a new lease of life. mamoru oshii made avalon, a live-action japanese/polish co-production about an addictive virtual simulation game. it was oshii's first film since his internationally successful anime feature film adaptation of ghost in the shell (1995) - he would go on to direct the sequel; ghost in the shell 2: innocence (2004). shot in poland with polish actors and a japanese crew, avalon's themes of virtual reality places it in the same territory as a lot of american produced cyberpunk that surfaced during the nineties: the lawnmower man (1992), strange days (1995), the thirteenth floor (1999), the matrix (1999) and cronenberg's similarly concerned existenz (1999) for example. it was also redolent of many similarly themed anime releases - both theatrical and televised - that emerged during the same decade as the real-life phenomenon of the internet started to make the world seem even smaller; oshii's own adaptation of ghost in the shell and ryutaro nakamura's serial experiments: lain (1998) series were particularly indicative of these technological and cultural changes. another notable example and precursor to much of the vr-centric work that would appear in the 1990s is the four-part anime series megazone 23 (1985-1989), which explores the idea of a post-apocalyptic tokyo existing as a futuristic virtual simulation. the second film from 2001 was sogo ishii's electric dragon 80,000v, which not only served as ishii's return to punk cinema after a decade of more meditative output but, like burst city, spearheaded a new generation of like minded filmmaking that has evolved japanese cyberpunk into a new and strange beast. as with the sensory assault cinema favoured by tsukamoto and fukui, electric dragon is a film that is experienced rather than watched, stimulating the most primitive parts of the brain in a tsunami of sound and image.  the premise is simple enough; a young boy contracts the ability to channel and wield electricity, acquired from a childhood accident whilst climbing some power lines - an ability further enhanced by receiving multiple jolts of electro-shock therapy for violent behaviour. now an adult with megawatts of power coursing through him, dragon eye morrison is a professional reptile investigator, searching alleyways for lost lizards. equilibrium is disturbed by the arrival of thunderbolt buddha, a tv repair man turned vigilante whose electro-conductive talents are the result of mechanical wizardry. the two meet and battle for supremacy on tokyo's rooftops. as was the case with burst city, electric dragon leans less towards the cyber and more towards the punk aspect of the sub-genre, with ishii following the train of thought he employed with his music videos and concert films during the 1980s. the film's title also makes reference to the old days, partly derived from 'live spot 20,000v', the concert venue that plays a pivotal role in burst city and one of ishii's early shorts, the solitude of one divided by 880,000 (1978). electric dragon is less about the nightmare and more about anarchic expression at odds with the post-modern universe. however, some cyber signifiers do remain; the oppressive tokyo setting realised in stark monochrome; the fetishist attitude towards power lines, aerials, ventilation ducts and other ubiquitous technological appliances; the hyperactive and frequently expressionist delivery; its low-budget, guerrilla-like execution and, like tetsuo, the concept of two characters augmented through technology, giving them powers that they can't fully control, coming to blows. dragon eye morrison has to clamp himself to a metal bed frame at night whilst thunderbolt buddha's penchants for electronic devices to assist in his nocturnal excursions sometimes get the better of him as he fights for control of his own body. the psycho-sexual themes that dominated past japanese cyberpunk have been replaced with an equally primal notion of animal magnetism. morrison's electric power is derived from the 'dragon' that's embedded in all living things. his rage unlocks the strength of the dragon, meaning that he can harness more energy by sucking it out of household appliances or by creating a non-melodic racket on his electric guitar; a high-voltage cacophony of noise and expression announcing that ishii's punk spirit is still alive and well. indeed, lead actor tadanobu asano occasionally guests in ishii's industrial noise-punk ensemble mach 1.67, which provided the film's propulsive soundtrack. the film would later be used to accompany the group's live shows, a strategy ishii pioneered back in 1983 when he made the short film asia strikes back - a little-known cyberpunk piece that provided the template for shozin fukui's preferred set-up of underground experiments gone haywire - to back up the album and tour of the short-lived punk supergroup the bacillus army. similar to tsukamoto's tetsuo, dialogue in electric dragon 80,000v is minimal thus the narrative is powered mainly by image and follows a similar template; the protagonist is seen acquiring his power; the antagonist then challenges the protagonist to combat and the final act sees them clash. all of this is wrapped up in a high energy, fatless sixty-minute package. ishii's film is not only is a throwback to the eighties cyberpunk manifesto but reminds us that rather than being characterised by heavy, science fiction concepts, as was the case in the west, it was defined by its independence, attitude and the will to create something out of nothing. the rise of 'splatter-punk' in the years following electric dragon 80,000v, a new wave of low-budget horror/science fiction began to surface largely thanks to increased dvd distribution channels, cheaper production techniques and the ever increasing reach of the internet. films like hellevator: the bottled fools (hiroki yamaguchi, 2004), meatball machine (yudai yamaguchi  junichi yamamoto, 2005), the machine girl (noboru iguchi, 2008) and tokyo gore police (yoshihiro nishimura, 2008) have ushered in a new era of cyberpunk informed, gore-centric movies that have since been termed 'splatter-punk'. these splatter-punk movies share the same independent spirit of their precursors, substituting 8mm and 16mm film methods for cheap dv technology, retaining as much budget as possible for make-up, costume and practical effects. many of the effects in these films depict mutation and body alteration; splatter re-imaginings of the flesh-metal fusions of tetsuo, and the perverse, organic weaponry of tetsuo ii. similar to the splatstick horror of early sam raimi and peter jackson, the effects and transformations lean towards the ridiculous for comedic effect. one mutated character in tokyo gore police wields an oversized cannon made of contorted flesh, protruding from his crotch much like an erect penis, suggesting - in a very tongue-in-cheek manner - the blur between sex and violence that was posited by tsukamoto and fukui. yamaguchi and yamamoto's meatball machine is perhaps the closest to the japanese cyberpunk of old; parasitic aliens infect unsuspecting people, which promptly turns them into macabre man-machine teratoids that fight it out. in many ways, this 'splatter-punk' phase is also reminiscent of the special-effects race that occurred with american horror movies during the 1980s; cronenberg included. as practical effects became more advanced, a seemingly never-ending slew of films were produced, trying to out-shock one another with advancing exercises in gore. the same can be said here; the ante seems to be continually raised as each new release contorts and morphs the body in increasingly elaborate and grotesque ways. a reason for this is that many of these film's directors initially came from special effects backgrounds: tokyo gore police director yoshihiro nishimura for instance, has supervised the special effects for many modern gore productions including noboru iguchi's the machine girl and robo-geisha (2009). in fact, many of these films are made through fundoshi corps, a production company founded by nishimura, iguchi and film producer yukihiko yamaguchi, that specialise in cheaply produced, over-the-top movies of this ilk. it has proven to be a successful business model as their output is continually building a strong international fanbase, looking for perverse and outlandish content. the recurring touchstones of combining eroticism and perversion are also present. however, they for the most part forego subverted techno-fetishism in favour of contemporary v-cinema and pink film preoccupations. the machine girl for instance, uses typical imagery such as the japanese schoolgirl - a popular conceit in a lot of the nation's anime, manga and pornography industries - and takes it to new abject levels, connecting bullet spewing hardware to her severed limbs and even granting her the ability to grow weaponry from out of the small of her spine; skirt raised of course. unfortunately, it would appear that live-action japanese cyberpunk cinema has moved on from the daring, experimental underground from whence it came. the remnants of its ideas are now utilised in violent gore shockers that are bereft of the immediacy and philosophical potential of their progenitors. the movement, once an expression of attitude, concerns and frustration with the world, the way it's structured and the technology used - not just an exploration of the grey area between science fiction and horror - seems to have disappeared. however in 2009, shinya tsukamoto announced his return to the world of cyberpunk with a third tetsuo project. tetsuo: the bullet man is not only a return, but a new beginning for tsukamoto as it is his first english language film; an attempt to expose the demented world of tetsuo to a wider audience. it premiered at the 2009 venice film festival to mixed fanfare, prompting tsukamoto to continue working on it. subsequent showings - the 2010 tribeca festival for instance - have found greater critical favour, but a vital caveat still remains like the punk scene that it emulated, japanese cyberpunk was pertinent and inextricably linked to a specific time and place. more than a sub-genre, it tackled the anxieties of the period in ways that conventional expression would fall short. but now that we're in the technologically dependent twenty-first century - the post-human nightmare now a grim reality - can it still be relevant? references  endnotes [ 1 ]. sogo ishii's biographical details were adapted from an interview with the director conducted by tom mes for www.midnighteye.com (posted 06/15/2005) [ 2 ]. 1982/1983 would prove to be a crucial time in the international development of cyberpunk. this period saw the release of four highly influential texts: sogo ishii's burst city (1982), ridley scott's blade runner (1982), the initial publishing of katsuhiro otomo's akira manga series (1982-1990) and david cronenberg's videodrome (1983).
