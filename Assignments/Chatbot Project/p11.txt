A little over three and a half solar cycles ago user jbains asked us on how to live a cyberpunk life in the country. This was a subject that connected with me because I have basically lived that life as a child–outcast by my so-called community at a young age, I lost myself in virtual worlds, some of my own creation and others in the form of video games. Instead of downloading music tracks from Limewire or Napster, I would borrow compact discs and DVDs from my local library and rip them onto my old desktop tower. By the time I reached high school, social media was quickly becoming an essential communications platform that entranced my peers and myself. I have lived half my life digitally; were the internet to spontaneously shut down tomorrow, I’m almost certain I’d die of organ failure. My time in meatspace, however, was miserable. I was the loner kid that preferred the glow of a screen over sunlight. Living in a small town isn’t all it’s cracked up to be–excluding tourist traps, the economies of rural communities have been collapsing steadily since Reagan was in office, which is why it seems like none of them have progressed politically since the AIDS crisis. So, by the time I slowly opened the floodgates of Media and the Internet in order to let the wave of humanity’s true face come crashing in, it was too late for me to socially adapt to society at large. Anyways, I was going to write this about a year back, but then a pandemic happened, and I’ll admit I was at a loss for words for some time before then. After all, I’ve mentioned before that cyberpunk rarely takes place in the countryside, and for good reason–the wide open spaces of the great outdoors are much less oppressive than the steel canyons and cramped, pipe-and-cable lined corridors you may be used to in your cyberpunk media. In fact, some of you who live in urban regions may be itching to get someplace less condensed after the shit fuckery that has come with city living over the past chaotic year, and living the “simple life” by proxy through certain farming simulators just isn’t gonna cut it. The good news is this: work-from-home employment is on the rise, and living out in the boonies without a long commute is a lot less pricey than many alternatives. The bad news is, well, everything else. You’re still living in a police/corporate surveillance state, plus trying to fold into a rural community can be next to impossible if you are  perceived as the “wrong kind” of minority, and ostracization can and will lead to rednecks fucking with you for no reason. Pile on top of that economic decay via automation and corporate colonization, rampant alcoholism and drug abuse, human trafficking, and the coming slew of climate change events that are too late to stop and you’ll find yourself in a fresh new kind of hell. But there’s still hope. Say you’re done fighting fascists on the front lines and you want to lie low up a goddamn mountain for a while. Just because you’re living in the middle of nowhere doesn’t mean you can’t still rage against the resource-hoarding capitalist scumbags in their glittering mega-pyramids. But the future won’t be found in doomsday prepping like your neighbor who’s been all-too-willingly eating up all the brainwashing material conspiracy theorists and conservative media warmongers have been shitting out since 1984. No. You, or a group of dedicated comrades, can take back the outside world and bring the future to them. Here’s my advice if you’re about to flee the city with your android partner, take it with a grain of salt. First things first. You need to get out of the city, but it’s been some time since the repo men came calling and took the only thing that was even halfway reliable in your life, and the beater you’ve been driving since might not even make it through the suburbs (or Media Zombie Territory as I like to call it). You could maybe take a Greyhound, but Uber’s not an option in the sticks, and trust me, you’ll need a car. I shouldn’t have to say this, but don’t fuck with Tesla. You’ll just be adding to the world’s pollution problem, not taking away from it. What you take doesn’t matter quite as much as whether or not you can get where you’re going, so look for cars that perform well in your climate region. Cars have been vital to rural life since the 1920s, and its denizens are well aware of this fact. After all, the relationships we have with the machines and tools in our lives is close, and only getting closer as we further interface with the Great Internet Overmind. Scarcity in smaller communities means that you’d fare better with something that is reliable over anything else, unless you’re mechanically gifted. If you pack light, desire better fuel mileage, have little regard for your well-being and/or are the Terminator, you could always go with the classic motorbike, but if you’re anywhere with extreme seasonal weather conditions you need to anticipate that and invest in something that will run when you need it to run. Necessities aside, it’s your preference as to how connected you want your soon-to-be self-driving KITT knockoff nightmare machine to be to the internet of things. The bad news is if you’re driving any sort of car with a phone functionality built in, you’re on the grid, and it’s harder and harder nowadays to find a car without digital components. So, if your desire is to be able to go full analog at any point in time, you may have to get under the hood yourself, or otherwise see if that sketchy mechanic with a pile of old chassises at the edge of town knows his wiring. From there it’s just a matter of how much effort and budget you’re willing to put into your vehicle’s customization. Tear out that default sound system and hook up a Bluetooth stereo with a touchscreen. Make sure you have enough USB ports to keep your devices humming–and if you don’t, cigarette lighter charge docks are so commonplace that you can probably find a bargain bin at your nearest pharmacy. Go ham and set up a vid calling screen that can connect to your phone. Turn your car into a mobile hotspot. Trim the interior with low neon lighting. Find any reason to line your interior with electrical cables and turn your vehicle into a mobile hacker’s den. Slap nerdy decals on that bitch, make it your personal collage canvas. Really, just do whatever makes you happy–the things you own don’t own you completely just yet, so if you want to drive anything from mopeds to luxury vehicles with autodriving features in the middle of the frozen Greenland tundra, that’s your business. However, if you can’t afford any of that, or you just want to blend in as much as possible, at least get something with an aux port (or god forbid, a CD player) so you can blast Perturbator’s “There is No Love Highway” on those dark, uncertain night drives in the country. Maybe someday we’ll see solar roadway projects come to fruition, but until then you’ll have to contend with the solitude of a world that only exists in your high beams. I have no advice on how to choose your living quarters because real estate is fucked no matter where you live. At least rent runs pretty cheap in the boonies, depending on how removed from society you are. However, once you find a location that suits your needs, be it a duplex, cabin, or farmhouse, you’ll want to make sure that you at the very least have a stable wi-fi connection. You may have to shell out for a decent router and modem, but you’ll be damned if you have to connect to the public network from your closest corporate-sponsored truck stop. That might be riskier than their burritos, which you’re pretty sure have been pulled out of deep freeze from the last millennium. Trust me, if you’re in flyover country, your access to fresh food is limited to your region’s non-corporatized farms, which are few and far between and cost far more than they should. But more on that later. An issue in rural life right now is limited access to what is for many small businesses a necessity: web access. ISP monopolies have had a chokehold in states with large rural areas since broadband internet became viable. However, some municipalities have been pushing back against the oppression of constantly rising service rates and have opted instead to create community wifi networks that give all local residents internet access at a greatly reduced rate. If community activism is your thing, that might be something to bring up at your next town hall meeting. It doesn’t start and end there, though. If you’re proficient in IT work, it may benefit you to operate as a freelance specialist. Your main clientele will likely be retirees, but there will be no shortage of work in places where computer illiteracy runs rampant. In a smaller, less densely populated region, you may find that your privacy will be invaded in ways that you don’t expect, disguised as country charm or some other myth of small town living, but keep in mind that when you’re online the same rules apply regardless of location. Keep your shit encrypted; use VPNs and anonymity browsers, secure your passwords, you know the drill. Not that you’re going to completely avoid the surveillance state and random Serbian hackers, that’s a bullet that can’t be dodged, but there’s never any reason to make yourself more vulnerable if you’re living 20km from the nearest sign of human life, particularly if you’re too broke to afford healthcare. Never leave your doors unlocked, be they physical or virtual, because small town cops are just like any other police force–not to be relied upon if the worst comes to pass. If there’s anything that the past year has taught me, it’s that the internet has evolved beyond my previous notions of its status as an increasingly elaborate image- and text-based network and has started to virtually materialize in a manner that is becoming crucial to our communication with others. No matter how far from the city you go, as long as you have a connection you can bustle about in the crowded street markets of Etsy, the barcades of Twitch, and the strip clubs of Onlyfans. Sure, it’s not the same as mingling in person, but if this trend of widening economic disparity continues, you might just have to settle for the virtual world to satisfy some of the things you miss the most. Unless, of course, you’re like me and solely use media to pass the time, in which case you might only need your internet for porn, researching obscure microgenres, and downloading video games. Either way, remaining plugged in isn’t as much a luxury as a necessity for many of us these days. In fact, it would be counterintuitive to try to take yourself off the grid–not only is it nearly impossible, but becoming a backwoods hillbilly with only a pile of busted computer monitors in your cellar for company isn’t exactly adaptive behavior. So, regardless of the fact that even if you live in a trailer park by the light of your screens, the fact that you have screens in the first place puts you on the map. This is just something you’ll have to get used to, unless everything really does turn to shit over the next few years. The big draw of living in rural areas is often that one can live a lifestyle more independent from governments and corporations–this is, unfortunately, a myth. While admittedly it is less crowded, supermarkets, mass-produced consumer brands, and fast food chains have had their hooks in many rural towns in the US for years, decimating economies through the empty promises of cheaper goods. This leads to lower average income per household, higher crime rates, rural decay, etc. So, needless to say, if you move into the country so you can eat a lot of peaches, don’t expect to find many entry-level opportunities. If you don’t have a career that can go wireless (and turn your living space into yet another place where you can be constantly put under the microscope by your employer) you might be better off trying your own thing. For instance, if you have experience in IT, you might find success in rural areas as a freelance specialist. Your main clientele may primarily consist of computer-illiterate retirees, but a paycheck is a paycheck. However, if your goal is near-complete autonomy from our megacorporate overlords, here’s where things get tricky. As it may have become abundantly clear to you in the past year, our system of supplying local communities with non-local groceries is unsustainable as soon as the plague du jour hits–not to mention it’s killing the planet. Fortunately, science is actually on the people’s side for once. Hydroponic (or vertical) gardening is a growing field of agriculture that uses compact, soil-light systems that can yield crops five times as quickly as traditional methods, is DIY as fuck, and may represent the future of local produce. Unfortunately, I’ve only just started researching the subject myself, so I don’t know the ins and outs of vertical farming at this point. However, the internet is not short on educational materials, the economic implications are staggering, and the results may look more like a solarpunk future and less than the Road Warrior-style wasteland we expect the countryside to become within the next 50 years. The beauty of hydroponic gardening is that it can be done virtually anywhere. Got a yard? Close it off with a greenhouse, rig it with as many vertical gardening stands as possible, and you could yield a crop of organic, pesticide-free broccoli grown within city limits. With some clever engineering, an old barn, silo, or machine shed that isn’t seeing any use can be refashioned into compact growing areas. Hang an oxygen garden on your bedroom wall that isn’t plastered with crypto art or occupied by your rig. Or, if your thumb isn’t quite green enough yet, start off small and grow an herb garden in your loft’s kitchenette. Chances are if it’s edible, the local farmer’s markets won’t turn you away. While hydroponic farming is still in its infancy, only offering simple produce items such as leafy greens as sustenance, there are kits that allow prospective farmers in any environment to experiment with different types of seedlings. And remember, once CRISPR starts being applied to crops, someday your dream of growing your own coffee or cocoa beans by the bushel north of the Arctic Circle might be possible. So, let’s say you’ve successfully turned a one-acre plot of land with a cabin attached into a compact farm of towering green-covered walls and are able to sustain your local economy with cheap, fresh produce, but you want to do more to shake off the chains of capitalism. Well, it’s not cheap, but if you’re tired of paying a power bill to a company belching toxic fumes into our thinning atmosphere, you could attach solar panels to your roof (if living in a sunny region; otherwise I recommend wind or hydroelectric), wire your electrical system to a bank of long-lasting car batteries, and you’ll be set to go until someone burns the sky. Here’s the tricky part. None of us can be certain what exactly the future holds, but current research is telling us that the global climate will get worse before it gets better. This means we’ll likely be seeing more droughts, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires, and freak snowstorms with increasing frequency over the next century or so. How this will change life in the country is yet to be seen, but don’t expect any sort of government aid to your communities. There’s also a reason why I don’t suggest you begin farming livestock–first of all, it’s really overrated, but more importantly, it’s almost as if Earth wasn’t designed to sustain seven and a half billion apex predators. The meat industry, along with just about any other Western enterprise, is helping destroy our ecosystem and will more than likely end with the extinction of the animals we so very much love to eat. So, whether you like it or not, our future will likely require us to find other sources of protein that aren’t as resource-consuming as the average beef cow. Fortunately, if you are like me and were raised on artificial flavorings and corn syrup, you might be able to find suitable simulacra without looking too far these days. For instance, extra firm tofu has a similar texture to chicken, and if fried with a little bit of garlic salt, onion powder, and corn starch, can upgrade any ramen meal. Likewise, Impossible Meats and other products like seitan provide meat alternatives that are nearly indistinguishable from the “real thing”. Even if you are restricted to making yourself black bean burgers on a regular basis, just remember this rule of thumb: liquid smoke is your friend. While the future might end up looking less like the Cursed Earth and more like the equally bleak, decaying society in Jackrabbit, one thing post-apocalyptic fiction gets right is this: water will become an increasingly scarce commodity over the next few decades, especially if corporations continue to lay claim to communities’ water rights. Whatever method of survival you choose in the great outdoors, access to a steady supply of clean water is going to be vital to any kind of lifestyle that could remotely qualify as stable. After all, hard water in rural areas isn’t always safe to drink as it is, so it might behoove you to invest in a water distiller before you start growing a third arm. I’m not saying you should hoard water. Just, stay hydrated is all. As much as I hate to admit it, burning down oppressive institutions isn’t the most constructive path forward in this thoroughly alienating world we’ve built. And while the tech bros in their silicon towers spend all their efforts on creating a robot they can fuck, we don’t have to live in their world. I don’t claim to be an expert on the economy or the environment, but I do know that our current method of wasteful consumerism will eventually run our children’s society into the ground–perhaps sooner, if Americans, Brits, and citizens other nations who ducked out of the Paris Agreement don’t begin adopting greener technology and production methods on a consumer level. But it doesn’t have to be this way, folks. We have methods available to us to, at the very least, wrest some economic control back from Monsanto, Tyson, and other processed food giants. It may be hard to believe, but if enough of us who have been displaced by the pandemic band together and create fortified communities in rural regions, we might just be able to get to the next screen. _________________________________________________________ Looking for alternative clothing, but sick of giving your money to the Man?

Welcome back to another Last Week in Cyberpunk, you neon drenched computer junkies. We have another fix for you in the shape of political revolution, some new tabletop games to keep you happy, and some new Alita news. This is truly a revolution of the people happening in real time.Due to hyperinflation, rampant homicides and countless food and medical shortages wracking the country, the 35-year-old head of the national assembly declared himself de-facto president on Wednesday, claiming the current president illegitimate due to the questionable nature of his electoral win last year. Guaido is trying to create a transitional government to help reshape Venezuela’s government, in the process painting himself a target as he attempts to save Venezuela from itself and Maduro.Surprisingly, Donald Trump was the first to recognize the new leader, along with Mike Pence. Many other countries then followed suit, such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Canada, Colombia, Argentina, and Western Europe. As a response, Maduro decided to cut ties with the US, giving US diplomats 72 hours to get out of Venezuela. However, the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo refuted the statement, claiming Maduro doesn’t have the authority to break diplomatic relations. Mexico and Bolivia, however, still support Maduro, along with Russia, China, and Cuba. Some are denouncing the interference from the US and other countries in Venezuela’s affairs.Many are worried about a potential disaster if the military support Maduro instead of Guaido, such as civil war. Internet watchdogs have also noticed that Maduro seems to be limiting social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to try to contain the rampant protests against his government.Why are millions of people taking to the streets to protest Maduro’s government, you ask? Simply because after Maduro took power, Venezuela has become a country with rampant hyperinflation. Shortages for everything from food and medical supplies to basic necessities like toilet paper and diapers have crippled the entire country, along with the highest homicide rate in Latin America due to all the corruption. The ‘Maduro diet’ has led to hundreds of thousands starving, with some resorting to killing animals in zoos in order to eat, and many avoiding hospitals because the facilities are more disease-prone than simply staying at home.As a result, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 in a mass exodus.This story is developing and is surely a turning point for the country, as leaders around the world are deciding which side to support. We have yet to see how this will affect the world stage, with countries taking different sides in the economic and humanitarian crisis.For the full article check it out here.The Dawn of Delivery Drone 6-Wheelers?Source: Starship TechnologiesIs 2019 the year delivery drones will finally take off? Or at least, roll out (pun intended)?After we saw Amazon’s flying drones capable of delivering parcels in the air, we now have a glimpse of what that might look like on land: cute autonomous 6-wheeler robots delivering food and possibly other small parcels to specified location. The idea was first started by Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis back in 2014, when they founded the robotics firm called Starship Technologies (I know, we love the name too). In the UK you can already find these fun autonomous bots wheeling around Milton Keynes, fulfilling grocery deliveries. Just this week, Starship just announced a partnership with George Mason University to allow their robots to deliver food anywhere on campus as well.And it’s not hard to understand the appeal. Not only do the robots look cool and futuristic, but it’s also very practical for those who are stuck in the library or on campus without much time to spare, or simply for those students who have the munchies and don’t want to venture far from their dorm room. In the age of Uber, why not have an app for food delivery to your door as well? Not to mention it’s 100% eco-friendly.Not to be outdone, Amazon has created its own 6-wheeler system as well, called “Scout”. Able to accommodate small and medium-sized parcels, Scout would only work with Amazon Prime accounts (of course), and is currently still being tested at Washington State University. However, sources indicate it looks considerably less cute, and is surprisingly quite late to the party, all things considered.Cable Investment Lowers Despite Everything Ajit Pai Promised After Killing Net NeutralitySource: Ars TechnicaTo the surprise of no one (except maybe Ajit Pai himself), following the repeal of Net Nuetrality investment in telecom companies like Comcast have actually gone down despite promises of increased investment, employment, and the spread of service to under served communities.Who would have thunk it that killing a popular internet protection for consumers would somehow have negative effects for the evil corporate telecom companies that Ajit Pai is owned by?Comcast is reporting a 3 percent drop in its capital expenditures (CAPEX) in their most recent earnings report, with similar reports by Verizon and Charter Spectrum showing lower network investments in 2018. Despite claims by the lobby group USTelecom and Ajit Pai himself that network investment was growing because of the prospect of killing Net Neutrality (which would somehow out of the aether bring investors banging down their door), there was no proof to back-up that claim, and we seeing now it was an outright lie.Plus, on a more human level, last year Comcast and ATT laid off thousands of workers despite claims of inevitable growth in the future. So either the companies want slimmer operations with advancing technology making things faster cheaper and easier, or they have no idea what their fucking doing. Either way, let us take a moment and say (all together now) Fuck You Ajit Pai.You can read the full article here.Cyberpunk MediaMoviesNeil Blomkamp Set to Direct Robocop SequelRobocop Returns will be based on a rough script that was already written back in 1988. Details are sparse about the movie for now, but original screenwriter Ed Neumeier tells us that Blomkamp is updating the original script with new screenwriter Justin Rhodes, and that it will remain true to Blomkamp style (so, definitely rated R). The synopsis for this project is the following: “Anarchy reigns and the fate of Detroit hangs in the balance as RoboCop makes his triumphant return to fight crime and corruption.” Looks like an exciting new cyberpunk tale continuing the nostalgia trends we’ve been seeing these past couple years.The Making of AlitaLast Thursday, 20th Century Fox released a clip revealing creative insights on the creation of the protagonist of the upcoming Alita: Battle Angel. Writer/producer James Cameron, director/writer Robert Rodriguez, lead actor Rosa Salazar, and producer John Landau talk about making Yukito Kishiro‘s manga come to life. Heavy emphasis is placed on Salazar’s performance, placing her wearing mocap equipment in the initial filming side-by-side with the finished product. The effect is a touch uncanny, but the amount of fidelity put into preserving Salazar’s spirit in Alita’s character is at the very least admirable. Alita: Battle Angel comes out in like three weeks you guys!BooksGolden StateDebuting on January 24th, Ben Winters’ latest novel, Golden State, is a post-apocalyptic dystopian novel released from Penguin Random House. It sounds like it’s got a little bit of classic dystopia in its DNA, and has drawn comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale. The description is as follows:Welcome to Golden State, where the worst crime you can commit is to lie. Laz Ratesic is a veteran of the State’s special police. As one of the few individuals allowed to ‘speculate’ on what might have happened when a crime is committed, it’s his job to find the full and final truth. But when a man falls from a roof in suspicious circumstances, it sets in motion a terrifying series of events which will shatter Laz’s world forever. Because when those in control of the truth decide to twist it, only those with the power to ask questions can fight back.You can get Golden State here.Tabletop GamesAndroid: Shadow of the BeanstalkRecently, Fantasy Flight Games, publisher of the Android roleplaying game and surrounding literature, has announced a new sourcebook to be released in the first quarter of 2019. Android takes place in a beautifully-illustrated technofetishistic future and puts players in the shoes of investigators attempting to unravel a mystery in a unique story-based experience. Shadow of the Beanstalk, however, provides a much wider array of character customization and sandbox gameplay, ensuring that no two games will be alike. Here’s the official description:Most of the inhabitants of New Angeles are just regular people living regular, boring lives. They wake up, go to work, order takeout from their favorite fast-food joint on their way home, then spend the evening with their families and friends, or logged into the Network enjoying an entire solar system’s worth of entertainment. Then they go to bed—only to wake up the next morning to do it all again. Yesterday, that could have described you. Tomorrow, you may wish it still did. Join us today as we preview some of the new character creation options introduced in Shadow of the Beanstalk, an Android sourcebook for Genesys Roleplaying! Shadow of the Beanstalk takes the concepts and rules of archetypes and careers found in the Genesys Core Rulebook and adapts them to characters living in the near future, in the bustling city of New Angeles, in the shadow of the beanstalk. These characters are supplemented with new equipment and skills to help them survive the day-to-day struggles of a world under corporate control, where advances in technology have made anything possible.Carbon 2185: A Cyberpunk Roleplaying Game Has Been Successfully FundedBuilt using the DD 5e rules by Dragon Turtle Games, Carbon 2185 has gone well past its initial goal of $13,203 clocking in it a staggering $74,933 with, as of time of this publication, 19 days remaining till the Kickstarter ends. We are always excited for new cyberpunk roleplaying games, with this one promising a detailed character origin system, pages upon pages of equipment, six brand new classes, and unique subclasses to further customization. The official description reads:Play as a Cyberpunk, a rebel refusing to live life by the rules of the oppressive megacorporations that rule San Francisco in this high action tabletop roleplaying game by Dragon Turtle Games. Carbon 2185 gives you the chance to play in the cyberpunk worlds you’ve seen in movies, television shows, and video games. The Core Rulebook is the only thing you need to run and play hundreds of hours of games in the world of Carbon 2185, and to enjoy our upcoming line of adventure modules, heists, and tales of corporate espionage using this innovative game system.You can check out the Kickstarter here.Video GamesCyberpunk 2077 Creative Director Leaves CD Projekt Red for BlizzardIt’s recently come to the attention of the internet that Sebastian Stępień, who was a leading mind behind the much-anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 since its original announcement back in 2012, has apparently jumped ship to take on another creative director position at Blizzard Entertainment, the gaming giants behind the Warcraft franchise, Overwatch, and the Diablo series. No explanation has been given yet for the sudden change, which is particularly concerning at this point in 2077’s development. Whether Stępień resigned from CD Projekt Red due to a pay increase promised by Blizzard or another reason, here’s hoping that 2077’s dev team will summon the ability to carry on and continue the game’s production with little delay.SplitJust announced on Steam, Split is the premier first-person puzzle platformer from Woodland Games that takes place inside a virtual world and looks to have similar reality-bending mechanics as gaming classic Portal, featuring time manipulation mechanics. No release date has been given yet, but the description is enough to entice any cyberpunk.In the year 2072 the global network has become so advanced that every aspect of the society was controled by an entity called the Shield System. The system was controlled by an autonomic AI that governed communications, monitoring, security as well as the aglomeration’s 24-hour lifecycle, among others. Millions of calculations per second, complex algorythms coding – all that just to make human life easier. Any outside input required has been reduced to the bare minimum. The AI did not need the human element, its presence only upset the order that the system created. For the man to control the system, there was a need to create a time control mechanism – one capable of creating clones in real-time to handle multiple advanced operations simultaneously. The mechanism was called Split.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week? Let us know down below or on social media.Some of the links included in this article are Amazon affiliate links.

Granted, there are MANY things to be criticized about Maduro’s government, but Guaido’s move is faaaar from being revolutionary. Instead, I’d point directly to Washington, since there have been atempts to unstabilize Venezuela ever since Chavez asumed as president. It is absolutely NO surprise that Trump was the first to recognize Guaido. It all sums up to one word: oil. As we say here in Argentina: no te chupes el dedo (don’t suck your finger). Plus, you’re quoting InfoBae as a source. Infobae is a media source that it’s known in Argentina for leaning very much to the right, and almost every note they post is simpathetic with the actual government. If you’re interested, I’ll leave you here other sources with different points of view. Cheers.https://www.counterpunch.org/2019/01/30/trumps-coup-in-venezuela-the-full-story/http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=251885&titular=venezuela-y-la-disputa-geopol%EDtica-http://www.rebelion.org/noticia.php?id=251929&titular=sobre-el-intento-de-golpe-de-estado-en-venezuela-https://www.naiz.eus/en/iritzia/articulos/venezuela-compradores-de-discursos-ajenoshttps://www.anred.org/?p=109612 Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   Steven J. Matos (Scum)   January 31, 2019, 3:35 am Hey, thanks for the thoughtful and informative response! The writers views are obviously his own (LWIC is the work of several writers not just myself), but  I’ll take the blame for the infobae image as I found that image (and had NO idea that was a right leaning source we are NOT down with that). The article itself, however, does not quote that site in any way. I’m not too well versed with the situation over there myself, but it would not surprise me in the slightest that this is all about oil. Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   DSteppenwolf   January 31, 2019, 9:59 am A revolution is defined by Merriam Webster as “a fundamental change in political organization. Especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed”. Juan Guaido is trying to change the leader of the government and the political direction of the country, along with the rest of the national assembly, thus I would definitely call it a revolution., especially considering over 80% reject his rule and over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country as a result. The protests are ramping up as we speak, not only in Caracas but around the world, but ultimately if the military doesn’t side with Guaido then all will be for naught. It could be argued that Guaido has only gotten as far as he has because of American support. I’m sure that Venezuela’s oil is responsible not only for the US’s fast response, but also for Russia’s quick counter-response to the US. But what about all the other countries around the world that won’t get any oil from Venezuela, and yet are still recognizing the new interim president? It’s also telling which countries are supporting which side, with the more democratic countries supporting Guaido while the more totalitarian countries are supporting Maduro.The main source of the post is from the New York Times, not InfoBae, as Scum mentioned. The link is featured at the bottom of the blurb. I suppose I should also mention that I myself have a close connection to this news story, which is why I wrote it. My family is from Caracas, and they fled the country back during Chavez’s regime when the country was starting to go downhill. Only a few cousins stayed, and  those that did had to live in constant danger and vigilance. It’s only gotten much worse since then.Anyways, thanks for your additional sources. Rebelion looks like a really interesting new source for a cyberpunk like me to keep an eye on. Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   JP   February 1, 2019, 5:16 am I’ll be very respectful about your opinion, and by no means whatsoever I’ll pretend to know more about what’s happening in Venezuela than you, BUT, you say that the countries that support Guaido are democratic and do not get any benefit from Venezuela’s oil, but it is an almost naive point of view, since it ignores the complex global political framework. When does Britain’s interests have not been aligned with US’s interests? Or France? Yes, Spain now has a “socialist” government, but up to this point it probably is as much socialist as Maduro’s. And let’s not talk about Germany…. Let’s talk about the democratic elected governments from Latin America that support Guaido’s claim: -Brasil: Bolsonaro is a former militar, mysoginist, racist, appologist of the last militar dictatorship; says that people should carry weapons, defends the idea that the police should “shoot first, ask later”; he proposes to advance on Amazonian territory to benefit agrointerests; he says that ideologies must be battled, especially the LGBTQ and genre ideology; one gay member of congress has already self-exiled himself for fear of retaliation; two LGBTQ activists have already been murdered, and there’s no sign from the police or from any authority to shed some light about that… -Argentina: Macri is a bussines man who came to power already denounced by corruption cases. He was supported by Clarin, the most powerful media conglomerate in the country and an acerbic enemy of the previous government. One of the first laws that Macri repealed, passing over the congress, was the media law, a law that was not exclusive to Kirchnerism (previous government) but had been developed together with many groups, 98% left leaning, surely, but it was a law whose basic purpose was to reduce the power of the mass media, reduce the concentration of media in a single group … granted, it wasn’t well implemented by the previous government, but thanks to Macri’s decree, a year later Clarin acquired Telecom, one of the biggest telephone companies and internet provider of the contry. Basically, it’s OC-fucking-P, or is on the way to becoming one. The Maldonado Case: dude activist for mapuche’s rights, dissapeared for more than a year after a repression on a road in Neuquén, from the government and from the officialist media they spread all kind of bullshit about him and about his whereabout, finally his lifeless body was discovered on a same spot that gendarmes had been looking soime months earlier. The official story is that he “drowned”. Rafael Nahuel: mapuche kid, participated on a protest for the same rights that Maldonado was supporting; got killed by a gendarme, shot in the back; defense ministry always deffended the gendarme. Also, there’s a massive inflation, basic services keep skyrocketing, also the prices of common goods… consume has dropped… the official EXCUSE has always been “we´re paying for the mistakes of the previous government”.And I could go on and on, but the point is: every governement that we had in latin america is far from perfect, but this new phase that started here, in Argentina, with Macri, is a new turn to the right/far right on the whole region. It is a return to the old politics, dictated by the US. It’s trying to undo the efforts of the past 13 years to create a regional block independent of external intromision, and, granted, I won’t “suck my finger”, I don’t think that kirchnerism was exactly all it claimed to be, neither them nor Lula DaSilva, or Chávez! But compared to the ones in the power nowadays… NOTHING good has ever come from US’s intromision on latinamerican affairs. NOTHING. And let me be clear, I don’t think Maduro’s right. I don’t support Maduro. But I DEFINITELY don’t, can’t support a US-handled-puppet as Guaidó. I’m mos def very biased by the ideologies I believe in, but I seriously can’t see a good outcome if Guaido is ultimately assumed as president. Not only for Venezuela, but for the whole region. And, again, I can’t stress this very much, I don’t pretend to know what’s the right solution to Venezuela, I’m just a schmuck, for what it matters, but I seriously don’t believe that the solution is turning control to a US dictated government.Y escribo todo esto en inglés para que todos entiendan, supongo que se entiende la inteinción, no?

Due to hyperinflation, rampant homicides and countless food and medical shortages wracking the country, the 35-year-old head of the national assembly declared himself de-facto president on Wednesday, claiming the current president illegitimate due to the questionable nature of his electoral win last year. Guaido is trying to create a transitional government to help reshape Venezuela’s government, in the process painting himself a target as he attempts to save Venezuela from itself and Maduro. Surprisingly, Donald Trump was the first to recognize the new leader, along with Mike Pence. Many other countries then followed suit, such as Brazil, Chile, Peru, Canada, Colombia, Argentina, and Western Europe. As a response, Maduro decided to cut ties with the US, giving US diplomats 72 hours to get out of Venezuela. However, the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo refuted the statement, claiming Maduro doesn’t have the authority to break diplomatic relations. Mexico and Bolivia, however, still support Maduro, along with Russia, China, and Cuba. Some are denouncing the interference from the US and other countries in Venezuela’s affairs. Many are worried about a potential disaster if the military support Maduro instead of Guaido, such as civil war. Internet watchdogs have also noticed that Maduro seems to be limiting social media websites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, in order to try to contain the rampant protests against his government. Why are millions of people taking to the streets to protest Maduro’s government, you ask? Simply because after Maduro took power, Venezuela has become a country with rampant hyperinflation. Shortages for everything from food and medical supplies to basic necessities like toilet paper and diapers have crippled the entire country, along with the highest homicide rate in Latin America due to all the corruption. The ‘Maduro diet’ has led to hundreds of thousands starving, with some resorting to killing animals in zoos in order to eat, and many avoiding hospitals because the facilities are more disease-prone than simply staying at home. As a result, three million Venezuelans have left the country since 2014 in a mass exodus. This story is developing and is surely a turning point for the country, as leaders around the world are deciding which side to support. We have yet to see how this will affect the world stage, with countries taking different sides in the economic and humanitarian crisis. For the full article check it out here. Source: Starship Technologies Is 2019 the year delivery drones will finally take off? Or at least, roll out (pun intended)? After we saw Amazon’s flying drones capable of delivering parcels in the air, we now have a glimpse of what that might look like on land: cute autonomous 6-wheeler robots delivering food and possibly other small parcels to specified location. The idea was first started by Skype co-founders Ahti Heinla and Janus Friis back in 2014, when they founded the robotics firm called Starship Technologies (I know, we love the name too). In the UK you can already find these fun autonomous bots wheeling around Milton Keynes, fulfilling grocery deliveries. Just this week, Starship just announced a partnership with George Mason University to allow their robots to deliver food anywhere on campus as well. And it’s not hard to understand the appeal. Not only do the robots look cool and futuristic, but it’s also very practical for those who are stuck in the library or on campus without much time to spare, or simply for those students who have the munchies and don’t want to venture far from their dorm room. In the age of Uber, why not have an app for food delivery to your door as well? Not to mention it’s 100% eco-friendly. Not to be outdone, Amazon has created its own 6-wheeler system as well, called “Scout”. Able to accommodate small and medium-sized parcels, Scout would only work with Amazon Prime accounts (of course), and is currently still being tested at Washington State University. However, sources indicate it looks considerably less cute, and is surprisingly quite late to the party, all things considered. Source: Ars Technica To the surprise of no one (except maybe Ajit Pai himself), following the repeal of Net Nuetrality investment in telecom companies like Comcast have actually gone down despite promises of increased investment, employment, and the spread of service to under served communities. Who would have thunk it that killing a popular internet protection for consumers would somehow have negative effects for the evil corporate telecom companies that Ajit Pai is owned by? Comcast is reporting a 3 percent drop in its capital expenditures (CAPEX) in their most recent earnings report, with similar reports by Verizon and Charter Spectrum showing lower network investments in 2018. Despite claims by the lobby group USTelecom and Ajit Pai himself that network investment was growing because of the prospect of killing Net Neutrality (which would somehow out of the aether bring investors banging down their door), there was no proof to back-up that claim, and we seeing now it was an outright lie. Plus, on a more human level, last year Comcast and ATT laid off thousands of workers despite claims of inevitable growth in the future. So either the companies want slimmer operations with advancing technology making things faster cheaper and easier, or they have no idea what their fucking doing. Either way, let us take a moment and say (all together now) Fuck You Ajit Pai. You can read the full article here. Robocop Returns will be based on a rough script that was already written back in 1988. Details are sparse about the movie for now, but original screenwriter Ed Neumeier tells us that Blomkamp is updating the original script with new screenwriter Justin Rhodes, and that it will remain true to Blomkamp style (so, definitely rated R). The synopsis for this project is the following: “Anarchy reigns and the fate of Detroit hangs in the balance as RoboCop makes his triumphant return to fight crime and corruption.” Looks like an exciting new cyberpunk tale continuing the nostalgia trends we’ve been seeing these past couple years.The Making of AlitaLast Thursday, 20th Century Fox released a clip revealing creative insights on the creation of the protagonist of the upcoming Alita: Battle Angel. Writer/producer James Cameron, director/writer Robert Rodriguez, lead actor Rosa Salazar, and producer John Landau talk about making Yukito Kishiro‘s manga come to life. Heavy emphasis is placed on Salazar’s performance, placing her wearing mocap equipment in the initial filming side-by-side with the finished product. The effect is a touch uncanny, but the amount of fidelity put into preserving Salazar’s spirit in Alita’s character is at the very least admirable. Alita: Battle Angel comes out in like three weeks you guys!BooksGolden StateDebuting on January 24th, Ben Winters’ latest novel, Golden State, is a post-apocalyptic dystopian novel released from Penguin Random House. It sounds like it’s got a little bit of classic dystopia in its DNA, and has drawn comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale. The description is as follows:Welcome to Golden State, where the worst crime you can commit is to lie. Laz Ratesic is a veteran of the State’s special police. As one of the few individuals allowed to ‘speculate’ on what might have happened when a crime is committed, it’s his job to find the full and final truth. But when a man falls from a roof in suspicious circumstances, it sets in motion a terrifying series of events which will shatter Laz’s world forever. Because when those in control of the truth decide to twist it, only those with the power to ask questions can fight back.You can get Golden State here.Tabletop GamesAndroid: Shadow of the BeanstalkRecently, Fantasy Flight Games, publisher of the Android roleplaying game and surrounding literature, has announced a new sourcebook to be released in the first quarter of 2019. Android takes place in a beautifully-illustrated technofetishistic future and puts players in the shoes of investigators attempting to unravel a mystery in a unique story-based experience. Shadow of the Beanstalk, however, provides a much wider array of character customization and sandbox gameplay, ensuring that no two games will be alike. Here’s the official description:Most of the inhabitants of New Angeles are just regular people living regular, boring lives. They wake up, go to work, order takeout from their favorite fast-food joint on their way home, then spend the evening with their families and friends, or logged into the Network enjoying an entire solar system’s worth of entertainment. Then they go to bed—only to wake up the next morning to do it all again. Yesterday, that could have described you. Tomorrow, you may wish it still did. Join us today as we preview some of the new character creation options introduced in Shadow of the Beanstalk, an Android sourcebook for Genesys Roleplaying! Shadow of the Beanstalk takes the concepts and rules of archetypes and careers found in the Genesys Core Rulebook and adapts them to characters living in the near future, in the bustling city of New Angeles, in the shadow of the beanstalk. These characters are supplemented with new equipment and skills to help them survive the day-to-day struggles of a world under corporate control, where advances in technology have made anything possible.Carbon 2185: A Cyberpunk Roleplaying Game Has Been Successfully FundedBuilt using the DD 5e rules by Dragon Turtle Games, Carbon 2185 has gone well past its initial goal of $13,203 clocking in it a staggering $74,933 with, as of time of this publication, 19 days remaining till the Kickstarter ends. We are always excited for new cyberpunk roleplaying games, with this one promising a detailed character origin system, pages upon pages of equipment, six brand new classes, and unique subclasses to further customization. The official description reads:Play as a Cyberpunk, a rebel refusing to live life by the rules of the oppressive megacorporations that rule San Francisco in this high action tabletop roleplaying game by Dragon Turtle Games. Carbon 2185 gives you the chance to play in the cyberpunk worlds you’ve seen in movies, television shows, and video games. The Core Rulebook is the only thing you need to run and play hundreds of hours of games in the world of Carbon 2185, and to enjoy our upcoming line of adventure modules, heists, and tales of corporate espionage using this innovative game system.You can check out the Kickstarter here.Video GamesCyberpunk 2077 Creative Director Leaves CD Projekt Red for BlizzardIt’s recently come to the attention of the internet that Sebastian Stępień, who was a leading mind behind the much-anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 since its original announcement back in 2012, has apparently jumped ship to take on another creative director position at Blizzard Entertainment, the gaming giants behind the Warcraft franchise, Overwatch, and the Diablo series. No explanation has been given yet for the sudden change, which is particularly concerning at this point in 2077’s development. Whether Stępień resigned from CD Projekt Red due to a pay increase promised by Blizzard or another reason, here’s hoping that 2077’s dev team will summon the ability to carry on and continue the game’s production with little delay.SplitJust announced on Steam, Split is the premier first-person puzzle platformer from Woodland Games that takes place inside a virtual world and looks to have similar reality-bending mechanics as gaming classic Portal, featuring time manipulation mechanics. No release date has been given yet, but the description is enough to entice any cyberpunk.In the year 2072 the global network has become so advanced that every aspect of the society was controled by an entity called the Shield System.

Especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed”. Juan Guaido is trying to change the leader of the government and the political direction of the country, along with the rest of the national assembly, thus I would definitely call it a revolution., especially considering over 80% reject his rule and over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country as a result. The protests are ramping up as we speak, not only in Caracas but around the world, but ultimately if the military doesn’t side with Guaido then all will be for naught. It could be argued that Guaido has only gotten as far as he has because of American support. I’m sure that Venezuela’s oil is responsible not only for the US’s fast response, but also for Russia’s quick counter-response to the US. But what about all the other countries around the world that won’t get any oil from Venezuela, and yet are still recognizing the new interim president? It’s also telling which countries are supporting which side, with the more democratic countries supporting Guaido while the more totalitarian countries are supporting Maduro.The main source of the post is from the New York Times, not InfoBae, as Scum mentioned. The link is featured at the bottom of the blurb. I suppose I should also mention that I myself have a close connection to this news story, which is why I wrote it. My family is from Caracas, and they fled the country back during Chavez’s regime when the country was starting to go downhill. Only a few cousins stayed, and  those that did had to live in constant danger and vigilance. It’s only gotten much worse since then.Anyways, thanks for your additional sources. Rebelion looks like a really interesting new source for a cyberpunk like me to keep an eye on. Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   JP   February 1, 2019, 5:16 am I’ll be very respectful about your opinion, and by no means whatsoever I’ll pretend to know more about what’s happening in Venezuela than you, BUT, you say that the countries that support Guaido are democratic and do not get any benefit from Venezuela’s oil, but it is an almost naive point of view, since it ignores the complex global political framework. When does Britain’s interests have not been aligned with US’s interests? Or France? Yes, Spain now has a “socialist” government, but up to this point it probably is as much socialist as Maduro’s. And let’s not talk about Germany…. Let’s talk about the democratic elected governments from Latin America that support Guaido’s claim: -Brasil: Bolsonaro is a former militar, mysoginist, racist, appologist of the last militar dictatorship; says that people should carry weapons, defends the idea that the police should “shoot first, ask later”; he proposes to advance on Amazonian territory to benefit agrointerests; he says that ideologies must be battled, especially the LGBTQ and genre ideology; one gay member of congress has already self-exiled himself for fear of retaliation; two LGBTQ activists have already been murdered, and there’s no sign from the police or from any authority to shed some light about that… -Argentina: Macri is a bussines man who came to power already denounced by corruption cases. He was supported by Clarin, the most powerful media conglomerate in the country and an acerbic enemy of the previous government. One of the first laws that Macri repealed, passing over the congress, was the media law, a law that was not exclusive to Kirchnerism (previous government) but had been developed together with many groups, 98% left leaning, surely, but it was a law whose basic purpose was to reduce the power of the mass media, reduce the concentration of media in a single group … granted, it wasn’t well implemented by the previous government, but thanks to Macri’s decree, a year later Clarin acquired Telecom, one of the biggest telephone companies and internet provider of the contry. Basically, it’s OC-fucking-P, or is on the way to becoming one. The Maldonado Case: dude activist for mapuche’s rights, dissapeared for more than a year after a repression on a road in Neuquén, from the government and from the officialist media they spread all kind of bullshit about him and about his whereabout, finally his lifeless body was discovered on a same spot that gendarmes had been looking soime months earlier. The official story is that he “drowned”. Rafael Nahuel: mapuche kid, participated on a protest for the same rights that Maldonado was supporting; got killed by a gendarme, shot in the back; defense ministry always deffended the gendarme. Also, there’s a massive inflation, basic services keep skyrocketing, also the prices of common goods… consume has dropped… the official EXCUSE has always been “we´re paying for the mistakes of the previous government”.And I could go on and on, but the point is: every governement that we had in latin america is far from perfect, but this new phase that started here, in Argentina, with Macri, is a new turn to the right/far right on the whole region. It is a return to the old politics, dictated by the US. It’s trying to undo the efforts of the past 13 years to create a regional block independent of external intromision, and, granted, I won’t “suck my finger”, I don’t think that kirchnerism was exactly all it claimed to be, neither them nor Lula DaSilva, or Chávez! But compared to the ones in the power nowadays… NOTHING good has ever come from US’s intromision on latinamerican affairs. NOTHING. And let me be clear, I don’t think Maduro’s right. I don’t support Maduro. But I DEFINITELY don’t, can’t support a US-handled-puppet as Guaidó. I’m mos def very biased by the ideologies I believe in, but I seriously can’t see a good outcome if Guaido is ultimately assumed as president. Not only for Venezuela, but for the whole region. And, again, I can’t stress this very much, I don’t pretend to know what’s the right solution to Venezuela, I’m just a schmuck, for what it matters, but I seriously don’t believe that the solution is turning control to a US dictated government.Y escribo todo esto en inglés para que todos entiendan, supongo que se entiende la inteinción, no?

January 27, 2019                  Copyright © 2018 Neondystopia.comWHAT IS CYBERPUNK?ARCHIVETHE TEAMJOIN USABOUTCONTACT Robocop Returns will be based on a rough script that was already written back in 1988. Details are sparse about the movie for now, but original screenwriter Ed Neumeier tells us that Blomkamp is updating the original script with new screenwriter Justin Rhodes, and that it will remain true to Blomkamp style (so, definitely rated R). The synopsis for this project is the following: “Anarchy reigns and the fate of Detroit hangs in the balance as RoboCop makes his triumphant return to fight crime and corruption.” Looks like an exciting new cyberpunk tale continuing the nostalgia trends we’ve been seeing these past couple years.  Last Thursday, 20th Century Fox released a clip revealing creative insights on the creation of the protagonist of the upcoming Alita: Battle Angel. Writer/producer James Cameron, director/writer Robert Rodriguez, lead actor Rosa Salazar, and producer John Landau talk about making Yukito Kishiro‘s manga come to life. Heavy emphasis is placed on Salazar’s performance, placing her wearing mocap equipment in the initial filming side-by-side with the finished product. The effect is a touch uncanny, but the amount of fidelity put into preserving Salazar’s spirit in Alita’s character is at the very least admirable. Alita: Battle Angel comes out in like three weeks you guys! Debuting on January 24th, Ben Winters’ latest novel, Golden State, is a post-apocalyptic dystopian novel released from Penguin Random House. It sounds like it’s got a little bit of classic dystopia in its DNA, and has drawn comparisons to The Handmaid’s Tale. The description is as follows:Welcome to Golden State, where the worst crime you can commit is to lie. Laz Ratesic is a veteran of the State’s special police. As one of the few individuals allowed to ‘speculate’ on what might have happened when a crime is committed, it’s his job to find the full and final truth. But when a man falls from a roof in suspicious circumstances, it sets in motion a terrifying series of events which will shatter Laz’s world forever. Because when those in control of the truth decide to twist it, only those with the power to ask questions can fight back.You can get Golden State here.Tabletop GamesAndroid: Shadow of the BeanstalkRecently, Fantasy Flight Games, publisher of the Android roleplaying game and surrounding literature, has announced a new sourcebook to be released in the first quarter of 2019. Android takes place in a beautifully-illustrated technofetishistic future and puts players in the shoes of investigators attempting to unravel a mystery in a unique story-based experience. Shadow of the Beanstalk, however, provides a much wider array of character customization and sandbox gameplay, ensuring that no two games will be alike. Here’s the official description:Most of the inhabitants of New Angeles are just regular people living regular, boring lives. They wake up, go to work, order takeout from their favorite fast-food joint on their way home, then spend the evening with their families and friends, or logged into the Network enjoying an entire solar system’s worth of entertainment. Then they go to bed—only to wake up the next morning to do it all again. Yesterday, that could have described you. Tomorrow, you may wish it still did. Join us today as we preview some of the new character creation options introduced in Shadow of the Beanstalk, an Android sourcebook for Genesys Roleplaying! Shadow of the Beanstalk takes the concepts and rules of archetypes and careers found in the Genesys Core Rulebook and adapts them to characters living in the near future, in the bustling city of New Angeles, in the shadow of the beanstalk. These characters are supplemented with new equipment and skills to help them survive the day-to-day struggles of a world under corporate control, where advances in technology have made anything possible.Carbon 2185: A Cyberpunk Roleplaying Game Has Been Successfully FundedBuilt using the DD 5e rules by Dragon Turtle Games, Carbon 2185 has gone well past its initial goal of $13,203 clocking in it a staggering $74,933 with, as of time of this publication, 19 days remaining till the Kickstarter ends. We are always excited for new cyberpunk roleplaying games, with this one promising a detailed character origin system, pages upon pages of equipment, six brand new classes, and unique subclasses to further customization. The official description reads:Play as a Cyberpunk, a rebel refusing to live life by the rules of the oppressive megacorporations that rule San Francisco in this high action tabletop roleplaying game by Dragon Turtle Games. Carbon 2185 gives you the chance to play in the cyberpunk worlds you’ve seen in movies, television shows, and video games.

Android takes place in a beautifully-illustrated technofetishistic future and puts players in the shoes of investigators attempting to unravel a mystery in a unique story-based experience. Shadow of the Beanstalk, however, provides a much wider array of character customization and sandbox gameplay, ensuring that no two games will be alike. Here’s the official description: Most of the inhabitants of New Angeles are just regular people living regular, boring lives. They wake up, go to work, order takeout from their favorite fast-food joint on their way home, then spend the evening with their families and friends, or logged into the Network enjoying an entire solar system’s worth of entertainment. Then they go to bed—only to wake up the next morning to do it all again. Yesterday, that could have described you. Tomorrow, you may wish it still did. Join us today as we preview some of the new character creation options introduced in Shadow of the Beanstalk, an Android sourcebook for Genesys Roleplaying! Shadow of the Beanstalk takes the concepts and rules of archetypes and careers found in the Genesys Core Rulebook and adapts them to characters living in the near future, in the bustling city of New Angeles, in the shadow of the beanstalk. These characters are supplemented with new equipment and skills to help them survive the day-to-day struggles of a world under corporate control, where advances in technology have made anything possible. Built using the DD 5e rules by Dragon Turtle Games, Carbon 2185 has gone well past its initial goal of $13,203 clocking in it a staggering $74,933 with, as of time of this publication, 19 days remaining till the Kickstarter ends. We are always excited for new cyberpunk roleplaying games, with this one promising a detailed character origin system, pages upon pages of equipment, six brand new classes, and unique subclasses to further customization. The official description reads:Play as a Cyberpunk, a rebel refusing to live life by the rules of the oppressive megacorporations that rule San Francisco in this high action tabletop roleplaying game by Dragon Turtle Games. Carbon 2185 gives you the chance to play in the cyberpunk worlds you’ve seen in movies, television shows, and video games. The Core Rulebook is the only thing you need to run and play hundreds of hours of games in the world of Carbon 2185, and to enjoy our upcoming line of adventure modules, heists, and tales of corporate espionage using this innovative game system.You can check out the Kickstarter here.Video GamesCyberpunk 2077 Creative Director Leaves CD Projekt Red for BlizzardIt’s recently come to the attention of the internet that Sebastian Stępień, who was a leading mind behind the much-anticipated Cyberpunk 2077 since its original announcement back in 2012, has apparently jumped ship to take on another creative director position at Blizzard Entertainment, the gaming giants behind the Warcraft franchise, Overwatch, and the Diablo series. No explanation has been given yet for the sudden change, which is particularly concerning at this point in 2077’s development. Whether Stępień resigned from CD Projekt Red due to a pay increase promised by Blizzard or another reason, here’s hoping that 2077’s dev team will summon the ability to carry on and continue the game’s production with little delay.SplitJust announced on Steam, Split is the premier first-person puzzle platformer from Woodland Games that takes place inside a virtual world and looks to have similar reality-bending mechanics as gaming classic Portal, featuring time manipulation mechanics. No release date has been given yet, but the description is enough to entice any cyberpunk.In the year 2072 the global network has become so advanced that every aspect of the society was controled by an entity called the Shield System. The system was controlled by an autonomic AI that governed communications, monitoring, security as well as the aglomeration’s 24-hour lifecycle, among others. Millions of calculations per second, complex algorythms coding – all that just to make human life easier. Any outside input required has been reduced to the bare minimum. The AI did not need the human element, its presence only upset the order that the system created. For the man to control the system, there was a need to create a time control mechanism – one capable of creating clones in real-time to handle multiple advanced operations simultaneously. The mechanism was called Split.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week? Let us know down below or on social media.Some of the links included in this article are Amazon affiliate links.

Matos (Scum)   January 31, 2019, 3:35 am Hey, thanks for the thoughtful and informative response! The writers views are obviously his own (LWIC is the work of several writers not just myself), but  I’ll take the blame for the infobae image as I found that image (and had NO idea that was a right leaning source we are NOT down with that). The article itself, however, does not quote that site in any way. I’m not too well versed with the situation over there myself, but it would not surprise me in the slightest that this is all about oil. Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   DSteppenwolf   January 31, 2019, 9:59 am A revolution is defined by Merriam Webster as “a fundamental change in political organization. Especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed”. Juan Guaido is trying to change the leader of the government and the political direction of the country, along with the rest of the national assembly, thus I would definitely call it a revolution., especially considering over 80% reject his rule and over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country as a result. The protests are ramping up as we speak, not only in Caracas but around the world, but ultimately if the military doesn’t side with Guaido then all will be for naught. It could be argued that Guaido has only gotten as far as he has because of American support. I’m sure that Venezuela’s oil is responsible not only for the US’s fast response, but also for Russia’s quick counter-response to the US. But what about all the other countries around the world that won’t get any oil from Venezuela, and yet are still recognizing the new interim president? It’s also telling which countries are supporting which side, with the more democratic countries supporting Guaido while the more totalitarian countries are supporting Maduro.The main source of the post is from the New York Times, not InfoBae, as Scum mentioned. The link is featured at the bottom of the blurb. I suppose I should also mention that I myself have a close connection to this news story, which is why I wrote it. My family is from Caracas, and they fled the country back during Chavez’s regime when the country was starting to go downhill. Only a few cousins stayed, and  those that did had to live in constant danger and vigilance. It’s only gotten much worse since then.Anyways, thanks for your additional sources. Rebelion looks like a really interesting new source for a cyberpunk like me to keep an eye on. Replyitemtype="http://schema.org/Comment">   JP   February 1, 2019, 5:16 am I’ll be very respectful about your opinion, and by no means whatsoever I’ll pretend to know more about what’s happening in Venezuela than you, BUT, you say that the countries that support Guaido are democratic and do not get any benefit from Venezuela’s oil, but it is an almost naive point of view, since it ignores the complex global political framework. When does Britain’s interests have not been aligned with US’s interests? Or France? Yes, Spain now has a “socialist” government, but up to this point it probably is as much socialist as Maduro’s. And let’s not talk about Germany…. Let’s talk about the democratic elected governments from Latin America that support Guaido’s claim: -Brasil: Bolsonaro is a former militar, mysoginist, racist, appologist of the last militar dictatorship; says that people should carry weapons, defends the idea that the police should “shoot first, ask later”; he proposes to advance on Amazonian territory to benefit agrointerests; he says that ideologies must be battled, especially the LGBTQ and genre ideology; one gay member of congress has already self-exiled himself for fear of retaliation; two LGBTQ activists have already been murdered, and there’s no sign from the police or from any authority to shed some light about that… -Argentina: Macri is a bussines man who came to power already denounced by corruption cases. He was supported by Clarin, the most powerful media conglomerate in the country and an acerbic enemy of the previous government. One of the first laws that Macri repealed, passing over the congress, was the media law, a law that was not exclusive to Kirchnerism (previous government) but had been developed together with many groups, 98% left leaning, surely, but it was a law whose basic purpose was to reduce the power of the mass media, reduce the concentration of media in a single group … granted, it wasn’t well implemented by the previous government, but thanks to Macri’s decree, a year later Clarin acquired Telecom, one of the biggest telephone companies and internet provider of the contry. Basically, it’s OC-fucking-P, or is on the way to becoming one. The Maldonado Case: dude activist for mapuche’s rights, dissapeared for more than a year after a repression on a road in Neuquén, from the government and from the officialist media they spread all kind of bullshit about him and about his whereabout, finally his lifeless body was discovered on a same spot that gendarmes had been looking soime months earlier. The official story is that he “drowned”. Rafael Nahuel: mapuche kid, participated on a protest for the same rights that Maldonado was supporting; got killed by a gendarme, shot in the back; defense ministry always deffended the gendarme. Also, there’s a massive inflation, basic services keep skyrocketing, also the prices of common goods… consume has dropped… the official EXCUSE has always been “we´re paying for the mistakes of the previous government”.And I could go on and on, but the point is: every governement that we had in latin america is far from perfect, but this new phase that started here, in Argentina, with Macri, is a new turn to the right/far right on the whole region. It is a return to the old politics, dictated by the US. It’s trying to undo the efforts of the past 13 years to create a regional block independent of external intromision, and, granted, I won’t “suck my finger”, I don’t think that kirchnerism was exactly all it claimed to be, neither them nor Lula DaSilva, or Chávez! But compared to the ones in the power nowadays… NOTHING good has ever come from US’s intromision on latinamerican affairs. NOTHING. And let me be clear, I don’t think Maduro’s right. I don’t support Maduro. But I DEFINITELY don’t, can’t support a US-handled-puppet as Guaidó. I’m mos def very biased by the ideologies I believe in, but I seriously can’t see a good outcome if Guaido is ultimately assumed as president. Not only for Venezuela, but for the whole region. And, again, I can’t stress this very much, I don’t pretend to know what’s the right solution to Venezuela, I’m just a schmuck, for what it matters, but I seriously don’t believe that the solution is turning control to a US dictated government.Y escribo todo esto en inglés para que todos entiendan, supongo que se entiende la inteinción, no?

DSteppenwolf   January 31, 2019, 9:59 am  A revolution is defined by Merriam Webster as “a fundamental change in political organization. Especially : the overthrow or renunciation of one government or ruler and the substitution of another by the governed”. Juan Guaido is trying to change the leader of the government and the political direction of the country, along with the rest of the national assembly, thus I would definitely call it a revolution., especially considering over 80% reject his rule and over 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country as a result. The protests are ramping up as we speak, not only in Caracas but around the world, but ultimately if the military doesn’t side with Guaido then all will be for naught. It could be argued that Guaido has only gotten as far as he has because of American support. I’m sure that Venezuela’s oil is responsible not only for the US’s fast response, but also for Russia’s quick counter-response to the US. But what about all the other countries around the world that won’t get any oil from Venezuela, and yet are still recognizing the new interim president? It’s also telling which countries are supporting which side, with the more democratic countries supporting Guaido while the more totalitarian countries are supporting Maduro. The main source of the post is from the New York Times, not InfoBae, as Scum mentioned. The link is featured at the bottom of the blurb. I suppose I should also mention that I myself have a close connection to this news story, which is why I wrote it. My family is from Caracas, and they fled the country back during Chavez’s regime when the country was starting to go downhill. Only a few cousins stayed, and  those that did had to live in constant danger and vigilance. It’s only gotten much worse since then. Anyways, thanks for your additional sources. Rebelion looks like a really interesting new source for a cyberpunk like me to keep an eye on.   JP   February 1, 2019, 5:16 am  I’ll be very respectful about your opinion, and by no means whatsoever I’ll pretend to know more about what’s happening in Venezuela than you, BUT, you say that the countries that support Guaido are democratic and do not get any benefit from Venezuela’s oil, but it is an almost naive point of view, since it ignores the complex global political framework. When does Britain’s interests have not been aligned with US’s interests? Or France? Yes, Spain now has a “socialist” government, but up to this point it probably is as much socialist as Maduro’s. And let’s not talk about Germany…. Let’s talk about the democratic elected governments from Latin America that support Guaido’s claim: -Brasil: Bolsonaro is a former militar, mysoginist, racist, appologist of the last militar dictatorship; says that people should carry weapons, defends the idea that the police should “shoot first, ask later”; he proposes to advance on Amazonian territory to benefit agrointerests; he says that ideologies must be battled, especially the LGBTQ and genre ideology; one gay member of congress has already self-exiled himself for fear of retaliation; two LGBTQ activists have already been murdered, and there’s no sign from the police or from any authority to shed some light about that… -Argentina: Macri is a bussines man who came to power already denounced by corruption cases. He was supported by Clarin, the most powerful media conglomerate in the country and an acerbic enemy of the previous government. One of the first laws that Macri repealed, passing over the congress, was the media law, a law that was not exclusive to Kirchnerism (previous government) but had been developed together with many groups, 98% left leaning, surely, but it was a law whose basic purpose was to reduce the power of the mass media, reduce the concentration of media in a single group … granted, it wasn’t well implemented by the previous government, but thanks to Macri’s decree, a year later Clarin acquired Telecom, one of the biggest telephone companies and internet provider of the contry. Basically, it’s OC-fucking-P, or is on the way to becoming one. The Maldonado Case: dude activist for mapuche’s rights, dissapeared for more than a year after a repression on a road in Neuquén, from the government and from the officialist media they spread all kind of bullshit about him and about his whereabout, finally his lifeless body was discovered on a same spot that gendarmes had been looking soime months earlier. The official story is that he “drowned”. Rafael Nahuel: mapuche kid, participated on a protest for the same rights that Maldonado was supporting; got killed by a gendarme, shot in the back; defense ministry always deffended the gendarme. Also, there’s a massive inflation, basic services keep skyrocketing, also the prices of common goods… consume has dropped… the official EXCUSE has always been “we´re paying for the mistakes of the previous government”. And I could go on and on, but the point is: every governement that we had in latin america is far from perfect, but this new phase that started here, in Argentina, with Macri, is a new turn to the right/far right on the whole region. It is a return to the old politics, dictated by the US. It’s trying to undo the efforts of the past 13 years to create a regional block independent of external intromision, and, granted, I won’t “suck my finger”, I don’t think that kirchnerism was exactly all it claimed to be, neither them nor Lula DaSilva, or Chávez! But compared to the ones in the power nowadays… NOTHING good has ever come from US’s intromision on latinamerican affairs. NOTHING. And let me be clear, I don’t think Maduro’s right. I don’t support Maduro. But I DEFINITELY don’t, can’t support a US-handled-puppet as Guaidó. I’m mos def very biased by the ideologies I believe in, but I seriously can’t see a good outcome if Guaido is ultimately assumed as president. Not only for Venezuela, but for the whole region. And, again, I can’t stress this very much, I don’t pretend to know what’s the right solution to Venezuela, I’m just a schmuck, for what it matters, but I seriously don’t believe that the solution is turning control to a US dictated government.

For a genre that often really tries to ground itself in, if not a realistic, then at least a vaguely probable future, cyberpunk misses more than it hits when it comes to human sexuality: especially considering the technological and social changes that are taking place right now. These too-often misses are even more egregious when also factoring in cyberpunk’s outlaw attitude: that the characters are predominantly cultural and social outsiders. Normally these kinds of people would be the ones who would be pushing the limits of eroticism—creating their own forms and pleasures without regarding what anyone might think of them. Instead, we mostly have protagonists who are woefully, painfully mundane when it comes to sex. Sure, there might be a secondary, or even tertiary character who might be LGBT or (oh my god) kinky but they are never featured players: existing mostly to give the book, movie, or whatever the illusion of being provocative and outrageous. For example in the (and, yes, I am going to go there) seminal cyberpunk novel, Neuromancer, there is only one brief sex scene. In fact, most of Gibson’s work steers well away from anything except heterosexual characters having heterosexual sex. In a word: Yawn! The same can be said of Richard K. Morgan’s Altered Carbon series, which completely and frustratingly misses just about every opportunity to thoroughly explore the ramifications of being able to exchange physical bodies. Not only that, but his frankly horrible sex writing generates more squirming nausea than anything close to arousal. A few authors, to give them credit, have pushed back against this unimaginative view of sex in the near future. In Richard Kadrey Metrophage there’s a polyamorous relationship and even a ménage à trois—though it comes off as more titillating for titillating sake than really being an exploration of future sexuality.  Much better is the sadly far-too-often overlooked cyberpunk classic Bad Voltage by Jonathan Littell which, while it doesn’t speculate on the future of sex, does feature a wonderfully depicted bisexual character—so much so that this book really should be held in higher regard as doing both cyberpunk and queer characters right. Similarly excellent is George Alec Effinger’s Marîd Audran series, beginning with When Gravity Fails, which creates a world where transgendered characters aren’t just present but accepted as part of his speculated Arabia of the next hundred years. And we can’t forget proto-cyberpunk works such as Jean Marie Stine’s brilliant Season Of The Witch—where sex reassignment is common and even used as punishment for sexual assault—and the mischievously delightful sexual decadence of Alfred Bester’s Golem 100 and The Computer Connection. There are no doubt other books that do well, what so many others do so badly—and please share your favorites—but the fact remains that even when cyberpunk does get close it is still far too dull when compared with what the next few decades will bring to the human sexual experience.  But before I get into this, do keep in mind that what I’m about to write about isn’t pure speculation, but rather is based on current trends as well as real scientific developments. Though, as always, I’m as guilty as cyberpunk when it comes to really accurate future forecasting. That out of the way, one of the biggest changes that are going to happen—and sooner rather than later—is society moving beyond the idea of gender. We are already seeing the beginning of this in the growing movement recognizing that gender is a personal identification and not limited by physiology: that what and who you are is your own decision and no one else’s.   What this means is that in the next few years gender won’t be limited to blue and pink but instead, there’ll be—and, yes, I’m going to go there again—a rainbow of possibilities. Instead of labeling anyone anything we will instead get used to simply asking, politely, what a person’s gender preference is. If you’re thinking about sex in all this, which is very different than gender, then keep thinking: with genetic processes like CRISPR andcybernetic augmentation, won’t the equipment people have down their trousers (or anywhere else on their bodies) will be just as variable?   Then there’s the impact of altering reality. No, I don’t mean Arthur C. Clarke levels of technology but rather when virtual and especially augmented reality become commonplace.    When this happens, we’ll be able to enter a completely unique, but ultra-realistic world, or have it visually combined with the one we already see around us. Human sexuality will then explode with new forms, styles, and pleasures—our erotic imagination allowed totally free reign. But one of the biggest changes is going not to be through technological innovation but social evolution. We are already seeing much of it already, from #metoo to gay rights: the growing acceptance that human society has to make some serious alterations in how we think about sexuality. Part of this is passing beyond old cultural behaviors and beliefs, especially ones that have outlived their usefulness while embracing new modes of behavior. Clear consent will hopefully become an integral part of life, with people accepting it both as a sign of respect but also as a way of being empathetic to the sexual needs/concerns of other people. Marriage will shift as well, with other forms of emotional and sexual interactions becoming equally prevalent: polyamory, relationship anarchy, asexuality, and even BDSM relationships becoming an accepted part of human society. There’s a lot more to go into, including the impact of being able to modify our own neurochemistry as well as the impact of artificial intelligence and robotics, but I think the point is made: cyberpunk needs to step up its high-tech/low-life game when it comes to looking at the future of sex. The good news is that the future isn’t going anywhere. There’ll always be time for writers, filmmakers, and artists to let go of the dried up old past of sexuality and instead give us some truly imaginative and speculative glimpses of what the future might bring.

I always felt this was one of the areas where cyberpunk was not true to being punk at all. Punks always reject norms, and hetero monogamous vanilla sex is a huge norm. Punks want everything else torn down, why would that get a pass? Sex is just a part of being human. If other parts of being human are evolving, this should evolve as well.   TW   January 24, 2019, 12:15 pm  I’m a big fan of the cyberpunk genre, but this is a fair critique.   Andrija Popovic   January 24, 2019, 4:10 pm  For anyone interested, Trouble and her Friends by Melissa Scott (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00MZIU2IA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) is a very good bit of cyberpunk where the main characters are anything but hetero-normative stereotypes.  It’s been one of my favorites for years, especially the way it deals with on-line play and identity.   M.Christian   January 24, 2019, 4:16 pm  So glad you all liked the piece!  Yeah, while I think that cyberpunk needs to step up its game I do have hope that we’ll be seeing some more inclusive and forward-thinking works in the near future.  Big thanks for mentioning Trouble and her Friends by Melissa Scott – totally forgot about that one: should def have mentioned it.   Steven J. Matos (Scum)   January 24, 2019, 8:35 pm  Oh man I need to buy that one now.   Curtis Lee Cancino   January 25, 2019, 12:19 am  The “problem” with discussing the future of sex is twofold: that being sex is had for reproduction and enjoyment. The cyberpunk aspect you wish covered here would fall strictly into the enjoyment-half of the equation. The thing is, humanity will always be binary, meaning that the ole in and out is where it’s at, regardless of the transgender agenda currently being pushed on society at large. The only way sexuality will not be binary is if humans somehow learn to mate like plants, as cyber enhancements will still focus only on the ole hokey pokey in one way or another. Queers aren’t special, they just prefer to be queer. That is nothing new in the history of the human species. The only true cyberpunk sexual revolution comes in the form of pleasure implants. With neural stimulattion, any problems of reproduction are completely removed, as it focuses totally on the pleasure aspect of sexuality; the enjoyment one gets from a coupling without having to couple, triple, or whatever. It remove the aspect of touch. So biopunk is really the only true sexual frontier out there, if there is one for humanity. Otherwise, a fleshlight is about as cyberpunk as things are gonna get for a while yet. #JustSaying   Curtis Lee Cancino   January 25, 2019, 12:20 am  Edit: … a fleshlight and a vibrator are …   Tsuchiman   January 26, 2019, 9:03 am  This is the better stance to take. Part of the overall issue with cyberpunk and sex, is that it heavily, and I mean HEAVILY, starts from the proposition of the “blank slate” theory of human physiology. From that position, sex/gender is assigned by “exterior forces”, i.e. language, society, culture, etc. So then folks in this camp leap to the conclusion that “everything is a choice”. And if you’re not paying attention too closely, that lands you in the camp of “sexuality is a choice”. AND if you take that stance, what you’re saying is all too similar to what anti-gay rights folks say: that homosexuality is a choice, and as such can be mediated out of a person, i.e. conversion therapy. (I’m forthrightly against this stance) You can extend this argument outward and start to see its’ negative implications. The problem is that the community who advocates that “everything is a social construct” only say so in order to radically change everything according to their desires. Which in part, is fine for their own ends, but there’s a thread of logic in this which aims to change EVERYONE according to their desires. No doubt in the future, people will continue to modify their bodies according to how their consciousness sees fit, extending into the sexual sphere. This also will interfere with our moral standards: right now, sex falls into the category of “what happens in your bedroom is none of my concern”. But what if people start to modify/splice themselves with literal animals? Behold, a man becomes a horse. Now what? Will that be accepted? Will there be “hybrid-rights activists” in the future? TL;DR: Sexual norms are ancient, “revolutionary” trends are not particularly new. But there needs to be a new critical stance that integrates evolutionary theories into cyberpunk fiction, and throw out all the tabula rasa in it. Otherwise, this genre will run into the vein of “flat earth fiction”.   Tsuchiman   January 26, 2019, 9:04 am  Note for readers: my comment was in response to Curtis Lee Cancino’s comment.   Curtis Lee Cancino   January 28, 2019, 11:58 pm  I don’t see the connection.   Neon Snake   January 25, 2019, 2:08 am  I’ll put forwards Ren Warom’s Escapology and Virology as books well worth reading, with transgender and queer protagonist and side characters. (Both are fantastic books in their own right) Side note: can we please not pretend that queers “prefer” to be queer, nor that a transgender agenda is being pushed on “society at large”? That’s nonsense and reductive, and treating either group the same way as we treat the overwhelming majority will not reduce the rights or quality of life of the overwhelming majority in any material way whatsoever.   shadowlink   January 25, 2019, 4:10 am  Thank you for that, Neon Snake. Punk, cyberpunk, biopunk, and whatever other kinds of punk culture out there should all strive to be more progressive–that’s the reason we exist, to challenge cultural norms. We’re in the damn future, let’s fucking act like it.   Curtis Lee Cancino   January 29, 2019, 12:21 am  I’ve studied conspiracies before it became a fad, i.e., before the millennial flip, so I’m rather bias upon what is happening in all media today. To me, “they,” the megacorps and media moguls, seem to be bent on the total eradication of the basic heterosexual family life and couplings that has created every single one of us, as they try to get everybody to be either queer and/or polygamous. By my saying certain people “prefer” to be queer, I’m not downplaying those people’s way of life, I just don’t know how else to respect who they are without wording it in an even worse and ultimately criminalizing way. Queer people are those who know what they like and pursue that lifestyle, is all I’m saying, regardless of interpretation. That being said, in my opinion, being gay or trans is not cyberpunk. Far from it! As I had said (or maybe implied) before, they’re both lifestyles from the dawn of time. If you study reality for what it truly is, this is a basic fact of life, in spite of what your favorite media platform is telling you. My question, based upon the idea of this article, is “What is cyber-sexual?” Well, “cyber,” in our day and age, directly correlates to and with technology. Period. Augmented sex glads still deal with spilling DNA. Whereas neural implants only stimulate the mental connectors, and may or may not result in physically busting a nut. At the state of sexuality that society is currently in, all people still need that touching and rubbing sensation to get off. If humanity is to ever truly become non-binary, those people won’t be human anymore.   Humans Are Absurd   January 29, 2019, 12:08 pm  You have the only response I agree with.  This agenda pushing of the writer, the media at large, etc. comes off as just another cyberpunk antagonist.  This “rebellion” against gender “norms” and sexuality “norms” is so hypocritical and illogical.  It bums me out that people think that they are non-binary when they are completely normal.  Fluctuation of  hormones in a neurological setting is very normal.  It is also very normal for individuals to be attracted to others outside of their normal preferences.  I guess everyone is bi or pan then, with social conditioning. The old ideas of the personal sexual simulations/A.I. are as “progressive” as anything could be because the user is the one picking and choosing. As for the polyamory stuff, it is generally a concept for insecure individuals.  Not that there is a clear amount of lovers that works.  Zero…or rather the A.I-esque lover is likely the closest to working in terms of a “relationship”. The consent problem that the writer brings up is so awful.   Allan   January 25, 2019, 8:51 am  Sad to know that the best cyberpunk sex is in Demolition Man… https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67DN3uvwXkE And worst is in Snow Crash hahaha   Silicon Sepulchre   January 25, 2019, 10:30 pm  I dont know… Snow Crash isn’t great but have you read The Windup Girl? Shockingly bad in that department.   Drexel   January 27, 2019, 11:58 am  haha I know right? (The Snow Crash comment).   Curtis Lee Cancino   January 28, 2019, 11:55 pm  In the book, Perfect People, by Robert Lieberman, there is a sex scene kinda like in Demolition Man, but it’s still a touchy-feely affair of sorts and less direct neural stimulation.   Drexel   January 27, 2019, 11:56 am  Very well written article. Funny how I thought someone might bring up Snow Crash due to the sex part in that, which was interesting and maybe a little illegal (YT and Raven). Thanks for the article!

So last week I spent what remained of my paltry monetary units from my occupation as a corporate wage slave on six pairs of mirrored sunglasses. Why, you ask? Because, dear reader, one of the many constants of cyberpunk are the mirror shades. For some reason, all cyberpunk works seem to have at least one character wearing a pair. Hell, the first (and essential) cyberpunk anthology is named after them. Maybe this is telling of the purpose–the eyes are one of the most expressive parts of the human body. By blocking the eyes, the wearers’ intentions become obscured, unpredictable, and know to themselves alone, and that’s how they like it. By using mirrored lenses to reflect the world back upon itself, it shows us that they see the world as it truly is. And also, they look really fucking cool. In an ironic twist, mirror shades seem to have largely grown in popularity as of late, not just across the demographic of obnoxious sportswear users, truckers, and police officers. But you’re not here because you want some Ray Bans with a rainbow finish or cat eye glasses with the star spangled banner on them. You live in the god damn future. That’s why I’m here to share my thoughts. I bought those glasses all for you, to give you my majestic knowledge in making an informed decision, dear reader. Let me be the Morpheus to your mirror shaded lifestyle. Unfortunately, we don’t have the ability to embed lenses into our skulls (yet) to make the most badass mirror shades ever, nor is AR advanced and cost-effective enough to provide you with a store-bought pair that you can install an adblocker into in order to blur billboards and television commercials from your vision. However, they will offer some protection from retina-scanning public cameras that you just know are gonna pop up any day now. Not that it’s the only way megacorporations and their puppets, the government, can invade your privacy to an unfathomable degree. Also, on the subject of AR glasses, Google Glass is terrifying. Choosing a pair of mirror shades depends somewhat on how much you want to stand out. And if you’re like us (mostly) you don’t want to stand out too much. Maybe just a little, because you’ve got a superiority complex like me and want to show everyone you’re a cut above the rest of the sheeple. Or maybe just because you still wear the same clothes you wore in high school because you’re broke as shit. Either or both ways, though they might be fun to wear, those wraparound visor sunglasses that remind you of Geordi LaForge have not aged particularly well. Unless, of course, you’re Drab Majesty and are therefore the only ones who are able to rock the techno-priest look. However, if my hunch is correct and the 30-year-cycle exists, the ’90s will be back soon! Perhaps now we can get back on track and acting like we’re in the world of Ghost in the Shell, as we should be. If you want to rock the retro look while it lasts, try to find yourself a pair of oversized visor glasses. These ones are actually a bit nice, a little tight around the ears and somewhat basic but if they made me feel like Major Kusanagi with the added benefit of not looking too unnatural. Something like these laser safety glasses are also acceptable. Essentially, if it looks like a pair of boxy monolens glasses tinted black or have mirror tint on them, you’re golden. And fortunately for you, they more often than not are within a decent price range, between ten and twenty third-order simulacra units. I tried to find a oversized version of the previously mentioned visor sunglasses (something like these, but with a mirror finish) in an effort to find another monolens style, but it doesn’t seem quite like they’ve caught on with the mass market as of yet. Just trying to complete my Motoko look is all. However, if you want to accomplish a more discreet, natural look, there’s always a pair of the classic Aviators. The style has become so popularized in recent years that you can go to as close as your nearest Dollar General and buy a pair for six bucks. There’s so much variety out there that you can practically get any tint you feel best suits your style for a decent price. But of course, if blending in is a higher priority, you can always stick with the standard mirror finish.  But as a nice bridge between standing out and being inconspicuous in a feeble attempt to quell your paranoia, I give you the John Lennon-style mirrored sunglasses. For some reason these keep cropping up, from Battle Angel Alita to Tetsuo II: Body Hammer. While it seems to be a more common style in Japanese cyberpunk (a plus, of course), they also seem to appear quite a bit in westerns (bonus points if it’s a sci-fi western). Between the two histories, it’s a somewhat international, timeless look. I mean if they’re wearing them five hundred years in the future, it’s gotta be, right? The unfortunate bit is these tend to run a little bit higher. But honestly, the ones I got are probably my favorite out of the shades I purchased on my little consumerist bingeing spree. Not that I’ll have any use of them at this time of year, when the sun goes down at 1PM in my region. Oh also if you want to get ones like Morpheus those exist too. Not sure how well they work though. Ultimately, the choice is, of course, yours on how you want to express yourself with cyberpunk style. Wear 3-D movie glasses, wear shades that look like they’ve been made by a replicator on LSD, make your own, don’t wear sunglasses at all, whatever you think suits you best. But if any of these styles catches your scope, go, buy some now! Add to the madness of society’s yearly consumer ritual that consumes an entire month and actually delivers little peace and joy to the mediocre! Let’s see if we can get that swirling cloud of pollution above Beijing to break free and consume the rest of the planet! Happy Holidays!   Chipper   February 13, 2019, 2:11 am  Personally I prefer Gargoyle Classics, as worn by Arnold in the first, “Terminator.”  Badass looking and if you have a large cranium, the classics look great compared to all other shades which today, are not designed for the average person.

This Week in Cyberpunk we see the data collection of a nation, the bending media to create a new type of reading experience, some exciting new content coming to Netflix, and a new book of sci-fi noir by Amanda Bridgeman.  In 2008, Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez dispatched Justice Ministry officials to China’s technology hub of Shenzhen. The mission was to discover more about the then budding technology behind China’s national identity card program. The plan, in accordance with Chavez’s so called ‘Socialist Revolution’, was to acquire this technology and give Venezuelan citizens a form of ID (most, then and now, lack basic identification for things like voting or opening a bank account). With the help of Chinese telecom giant ZTE Corp, the officials were shown how the card could be used to monitor not just basic data such as birth dates or ID numbers, but political, social, and economic behaviors. Ten years and $70 million dollars later, the ‘carnet de la patria’ or ‘fatherland card’ is being rolled out in Venezuela which can transmit data about the user to a computer server (all created by ZTE) while allowing a card user to access government welfare programs (which people desperately need). “It’s blackmail,” Héctor Navarro, one of the founders of the ruling Socialist Party and a former minister under Chávez, said of the fatherland program. “Venezuelans with the cards now have more rights than those without.” Check out the full story here. Youtube CEO Susan Wojcicki most recent blog post states, using the all-time most popular video Despacito as an example which uses several copyrights who are unknown or disputed, that to enforce Article 13 would be to censor this video and deny its creator the massive amounts of ad revenue and views the video has generated.Her posts goes on, “The consequences of article 13 go beyond financial losses. EU residents are at risk of being cut off from videos that, in just the last month, they viewed more than 90bn times. Those videos come from around the world, including more than 35m EU channels, and they include language classes and science tutorials as well as music videos. We welcome the chance to work with policymakers and the industry to develop a solution within article 13 that protects rights holders while also allowing the creative economy to thrive. This could include more comprehensive licensing agreements, collaboration with rights holders to identify who owns what, and smart rights management technology, similar to Content ID.”Nebula Genomics trades DNA testing for personal informationHow much is your privacy worth over your personal information? This hypothetical question has become drastically less hypothetical since the rise of computing, big data, and the online survey. However, a new start-up is taking that question to another level. Nebula Genomics has announced that it will offer services such as free genome sequences in exchange for your personal health information, such as personal and family medical history. Researchers need data, and DNA testing has become extremely popular, so Nebula Genomics business model may not be a bad one.

The Subjugate captures the noir spirit of cyberpunk with its crime thriller story. Amanda Bridgeman is the author of seven previous books including the Aurora series and The Time of Stripes. The synopsis for The Subjugate is below:In a small religious community rocked by a spree of shocking murders, Detectives Salvi Brentt and Mitch Grenville find themselves surrounded by suspects. The Children of Christ have a tight grip on their people, and the Solme Complex neurally edit violent criminals – Subjugates – into placid servants called Serenes. In a town where purity and sin, temptation and repression live side by side, everyone has a motive. But as the bodies mount up, the frustrated detectives begin to crack under the pressure: their demons are coming to light, and who knows where that blurred line between man and monster truly lies. You can get it here.Video GamesHovercar Courier Simulator Cloudpunk AnnouncedSet for release sometime in 2019, developer Ion Lands’ Cloudpunk tells the story of Rania, a jaded employee of a “semi-legal” delivery service in the vertigo-inducing city of Nivalis. The game seems to promise a story-based experience pulsing with voxel-based life as you live a night in Rania’s shoes, coming across shady megacorporations, hackers, androids, and rogue AI. Keep an eye out for this one; we know we will.Light Fairytale Episode 1: Now on Early AccessAfter a long wait, the first episode of Neko.works’ cyberpunk JRPG hit Steam’s digital shelves on November 12th. The trailers and gameplay footage don’t tell much, but what can be gleaned is that humanity has been forced into an underground metropolis ruled by a totalitarian government. The plot seems to revolve around a young protagonist who comes across an escaped humanoid weapon. While the world’s grittiness seems to be glossed over by a heavy coating of cutesy-anime-flavored sugar, its neon-soaked appearance practically bleeds the tropes we know and love. Light Fairytale is slated for release on all major consoles, but while it’s on early access, it can only be purchased on Windows. If you’re a fan of turn-based RPGs in the vein of Final Fantasy VII, this may be worthy of your Steam wishlist.VR cyberpunk game coming soon Scraper: New strikeA full trailer is out this week for Scraper: New Strike. This VR game from Labrodex Studios will be the first in a series of RPG shooters set in a cyberpunk future of New Austin, 2076. In this dystopia, humans have put powerful AIs known as Humechs in charge of their cities and their lives. The plot of the game looks like it will pull on the kind of threads we love in cyberpunk, such as the fine line between utopia and dystopia, and the role that powerful AIs could play in navigating that line. You play as an operator of a hovering combat pod, which you can upgrade throughout the game. According to the studio, the game will include engineering, scavenging and dynamic missions along with shooter elements, which have been positively reviewed so far. A gameplay trailer shows a Mass Effect style combat.A novel was released in collaboration with Labrodex Studios by Ryder Windham titled Scraper: The Rise of Cifer and is out now. You can get it here. Scraper: New Strike will be available for PC VR 11/21 and for PS VR 12/18.New Alita Trailer Teases Character ArcThe past trailers for Alita: Battle Angel have suggested a more innocent coming-of-age tale in the horrifying future the original manga and anime foretold, but in Fox’s latest glimpse of the upcoming feature film, we can see that there are darker notes that will hopefully underscore the narrative. Battle Angel Alita fans will notice iconic images from both the manga and the anime, as well as some new material. Unfortunately, the premiere has been pushed back to Valentine’s Day 2019 (possibly due to the copious downsizing of lead actress Rosa Salazar’s eyes) but this is shaping up to be director Robert Rodriguez‘s most emotional, if not impactful, work to date.The IntrafaceIt’s not often we get cyberpunk from France, but the teaser trailer for indie studios Fraktal and Discovr’s collaborative short film The Intraface gives us a sneak peek into a world warped by a device that allows users to connect their minds directly to the internet and other users. While this is a concept that has been explored beforein science fiction, the trailer cuts between a brief unveiling of the device and a user that appears to be brain dead. It’s anyone’s guess as to what the plot will look like, but fortunately we won’t be kept in suspense for too long–the film makes its debut on November 29th.New Cyberpunk comic Neon Wasteland features interactive AR appNeon Wasteland is a new upcoming interactive and animated AR comic book from Rob Shields that comes with its own AR app online free for download. Although viewable on its own, the AR aspect of the comic blurs the line with this type of media, making it a mix between a comic book, a videogame, and a cartoon. In the future you will be able to make choices in the comic, and unlock items to reveal extra plot points or clues about what is to come in the comic itself. It also comes with a reset token so you can go back to the beginning and make different choices during your comic book experience. Check out their kickstarter here, at the time of this publication they’ve raised about $15k in funds so far.Inspired by late 1980s Japanese Cyberpunk animation, Neon Wasteland is a story set in 2088 where most humans live in the omniverse of digital immortality while the rest live in factory slums called Earth. When a sudden outbreak of undead mutant soldiers overruns the camps of two rival gangs, they begin to question the nature of reality as they discover the truth. Described as The Matrix meets Mad Max of sorts, this media-bending comic looks like it will be fun as hell.New Cyberpunk Anime coming to Netflix includes Pacific Rim, Altered Carbon adaptationsLast week Netflix revealed five new upcoming anime series. The first will be set in the Pacific Rim Universe, following 2 siblings who learn to pilot an abandoned jaeger as they look for their parents. It’ll be produced by Legendary Entertainment and feature writer Craig Kyle (Thor Ragnarok).The second will be set in the Altered Carbon Universe, exploring different aspects than what was covered in the live-action show. Included on this project is Dai Sato (Cowboy Bebop, Samurai Champloo).Unfortunately, Netflix still hasn’t announced release dates for any of these projects yet, but they should come out sometime in 2019.What are you most excited about this week?

November 17, 2018  Youtube CEO Susan Wojcicki most recent blog post states, using the all-time most popular video Despacito as an example which uses several copyrights who are unknown or disputed, that to enforce Article 13 would be to censor this video and deny its creator the massive amounts of ad revenue and views the video has generated. Her posts goes on, “The consequences of article 13 go beyond financial losses. EU residents are at risk of being cut off from videos that, in just the last month, they viewed more than 90bn times. Those videos come from around the world, including more than 35m EU channels, and they include language classes and science tutorials as well as music videos. We welcome the chance to work with policymakers and the industry to develop a solution within article 13 that protects rights holders while also allowing the creative economy to thrive. This could include more comprehensive licensing agreements, collaboration with rights holders to identify who owns what, and smart rights management technology, similar to Content ID.”  How much is your privacy worth over your personal information? This hypothetical question has become drastically less hypothetical since the rise of computing, big data, and the online survey. However, a new start-up is taking that question to another level. Nebula Genomics has announced that it will offer services such as free genome sequences in exchange for your personal health information, such as personal and family medical history.

News this week brings us a dissection of a classic from the creator himself, internet prices may go up while coverage drops, Fancy Bear gets interested in European elections, but we can watch a baby xenomorph and a lamb put the beauty of nature on full display. Let’s see what happened this Last Week in Cyberpunk. Getty Images Former investment banker turned Independent candidate Emmanuel Macron, gave many French voters a reason to feel secure as he emerged victorious from the first round of elections, coming out three points ahead of National Front candidate La Pen. But there may be reason to worry, now that a familiar occurrence from the US elections in 2016 has found its way to France. According to cybersecurity firm Trend Micro, the Macron campaign was targeted on March 15 by Fancy Bear, the same state actors that targeted the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Convention in 2016. Both Macron’s emails and one drive accounts were targeted by the group. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, facing an election later this year, has claimed that her office and affiliated party have also been targeted by the same group. What does this mean for the global political stage? Daniel Acker/Bloomberg At a speech hosted by FreedomWorks, the group known for propping up the rightist Tea Party movement, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai announced that his agency is now ready to get rid of those Title II protections that keep net neutrality intact, claiming that net neutrality proponents were “looking for an excuse to achieve their longstanding goal of forcing the internet under the federal government’s control.” Title II protections means ISPs have to disclose hidden fees and data caps to consumers and regulating internet connection payments which can throttle connections and boost costs for a stable connection in any given area. For those in low-income areas, don’t worry, Pai hasn’t forgotten you: “without the overhang of heavy-handed regulation, companies will spend more building next-generation networks.” Trickle-down broadband? Erika Bain via Facebook Plan on taking a trip down to South Florida? Want to see if you’re lucky enough to catch a glimpse of President Donald Trump in his natural habitat? Well, the US State Department knows just where you should plan your stay. The Bureau of International Information Program (BoIIP) published what seems to be sponsored content on behalf the Trump-owned Mar-a-Largo country club. This is essentially an advertisement that would directly enrich Trump, which would violate the Domestic Emoluments Clause in the Constitution. In their defense, the BoIIP claimed that the article was published “to inform the public about where the president has been hosting world leaders.” No word yet of any disciplinary action taken in response to the article. Apple CEO Tim Cook Uber would hope all the news you consumed this week concerned their VTOL taxis they hope to have in select cities by 2020. Given this company’s love for self-inflicted wounds, that’s not the case. Earlier this week it was revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook threatened to delete the ride-sharing app after a confrontation with CEO Travis Kalanick, the same executive who got into a shouting match with a driver not too long ago. The incident in question took place in 2015 after Cook learned that the Uber app violated Apple’s user privacy policy by “geofencing” customers in an attempt to combat fraud committed by drivers. After deletion, those who had downloaded the Uber app had their iPhones were still being monitored by the company. Kalanick was reportedly shaken by the confrontation and the threat of removal, but the official company position is that Uber does not “track individual users or their location if they’ve deleted the app.” At the time of this reporting, the Uber app rates at 1.6 out of 5 stars on the Apple App Store. Kristan Lieb / Blue Sky Jimmy Wales, co-founder of Wikipedia, is hoping intrepid journalists will be willing to edit news in real time to better chronicle current events with verifiable info and combat the epidemic of fake news. Wikitribune works on a donation-only system like its encyclopedic cousin and ditch ads. Wales is hoping that removing the pay-walls of traditional newspaper websites and eliminating revenue from ads will limit the number of fabricated stories and centralize actual events on one site.  One star that hasn’t been getting enough screen time in the run up to the release of Alien: Covenant is the Lunar Quattro, a small rover designed by Audi and German space start-up Part-Time Scientists. Quattro has been in development since 2015 for a mission to the moon, but first, it’s going to help some pretend scientists (maybe?) stay alive.  Researchers at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHoP) designed the “biobag” which allowed them to take a premature lamb and complete its gestation. This extra-uterine fetal incubation method proved effective and mostly safe, with the lambs carried to term in their biobags with only mild inflammation of the lungs detected. Researchers see human testing for similar incubation methods just a handful of years away. You can read the entire paper on their research here. Reebok Ripley’s famous kicks get a redesign for their new movie. This time there are sizes for men and women. Just be careful with acid. That’s bad for everyone. Getty Images Gemini Man seems to have clawed its way out of development hell. After being pitched in 1997, this thriller, where an aging assassin and his younger clone face each other for the first time, finally has Ang Lee attached to direct and Will Smith to star.  Peter Weyland’s little boy may be all grown up, but what happened to the woman who saved David’s life at the end of Prometheus? Ridley Scott released a short film that ought to shed some light on the fate of Dr. Elizabeth Shaw ahead of Alien: Covenant.  Paid close attention in biology class? Even if you did, it never hurts to get a refresher course on the beautiful life cycle of a xenomorph as it leaves the comfort of a facehugger’s womb and eventually burst from the chest of some hapless space trucker. Or a scientist. Even an engineer. Facehuggers are pretty open-minded. Fans can grab their Oculus Rift and witness the majesty of alien procreation in VR right now.  Adam Savage takes a step inside the Engineer dreadnought ahead of filming for Alien: Covenant and is almost driven to tears.  Retrowave goes with neon glow in the trailer for the neo-noir thriller the Persian Collection. Watch as a child soldier is smuggled into in Los Angeles, then becomes a man intent on escaping the Persian underworld that claims to own him. Android: Netrunner A new campaign for Netrunner fans drops a murder mystery in the new Terminal Directive. Corp and Runner compete in a thrilling race for the control of valuable data that plays out over the course of an extended campaign. Each match impacts the larger shape of your investigations. Each data set you unlock leads you in a new direction. You may have run before. You may have pursued your corporate agendas. But nothing you’ve done has yet prepared you for Terminal Directive and the narrative-driven campaign play it brings to Android: Netrunner.  17 years since its creation, Deus Ex continues to be an influence on role-playing games and the video game industry as a whole. Celebrated game designer Warren Spector breaks down how the game was made and why he’s most proud of this cyberpunk classic from the GDC stage. Samaritan #1 Here’s something to put on your pull list this week: Samaritan. This new title from Image Comics plans to bankrupt the most successful private military company in the world by making them obsolete. Can the US government stop one troublemaker from making everyone a warlord?  Though you can witness his political opinions in real time, cyberpunk godfather William Gibson will tell us how he really feels about Clinton losing the 2016 election in Agency. The novel will imagine a present where Hillary Clinton is sworn in as the 45th President of the United States and a 22nd century London that takes place after the events of The Peripheral. In an interview with the New York Times, Gibson explained that he had begun drafting Agency before November. After the election was decided he had to go back and re-imagine his fiction future, saying “Every imaginary future ever written is about the time it was written in. People talk about science fiction’s predictive possibilities, but that’s a byproduct. It’s all really about now.” Readers will be able to explore all the possibilities of Agency on January 16, 2018. That was a lot to get there but there’s still a chance we missed something. If we did, let us know down below or on social media. Your email address will not be published.

The original translation of Kirtchev’s A Cyberpunk Manifesto, now 20 years old and translated from Bulgarian, is not exactly known for its perfect English. If you are a native English speaker, it can even be jarring to read at times. In a conversation with Kirtechv, himself, he told me, “ “It is written by a Eastern European in a former Soviet Bloc satellite country after the fall of communism. It is even given as a study at English class in a college to examine the ‘broken english’.“ Together, Kirtchev and I have slightly revised the original translation to smooth over the roughest portions while striving to leave the original intent untarnished. The below-revised version of A Cyberpunk Manifesto is published with the permission of Christian A. Kirtchev, the original author. By Christian A. Kirtchev We are the Electronic Minds, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks. We live in Cyberspace. We are everywhere. We know no boundaries. This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks’ manifest. 1. We are those, the Different. Outsiders. Technological rats, swimming in the ocean of information 2. We are the introverted little kid at school, sitting at the last desk in the corner of the classroom. 3. We are the teenager all his classmates consider strange. 4. We are the student hacking computer systems, exploring the depth of his reach. 5. We are the grown-up in the park sitting on a bench, laptop on his knees, programming the latest virtual reality. 6. Ours is the garage stuffed with electronics. The soldering iron on the corner of a desk and nearby, the disassembled radio – they are also ours. Ours is the cellar with computers, buzzing printers, and beeping modems. 7. We are those that see reality differently. Our point of view sees beyond what ordinary people can perceive. They see what is outside, but we see what is inside. That’s what we are, realists with the glasses of dreamers. 8. We are those strange people, almost unknown to the neighborhood. People indulged in their thoughts, sitting day after day before the computer, ransacking the net for something. We are not often away from home. We occasionally leave and only to go to the nearby radio shack, to the usual bar to meet some of our few friends, to meet a client, to the backstreet druggist, or just for a little walk. 9. We don’t have many friends, only a few with whom we go to parties. Everybody else we know, we know on the net. Our real friends are there, on the other side of the line. We know them from our favorite IRC channel, from the News-Groups, or from the systems that we hang around. 10. We are those who don’t give a shit about what people think about us. We don’t care what we look like in the eyes of others, or what people say behind our backs. 11. The majority of us like to live in hiding, unknown to all except those few with which we must inevitably have contact. 12. Others love publicity. They love fame. They are known in the underground. Their names are often heard there. But we are all united by one thing: We are Cyberpunks. 13. Society does not understand us. We are “weird” and “crazy” in the eyes of ordinary people who live far from pure information and free ideas. Society denies our way of thinking – a society, living, thinking and breathing in one and only one way – a cliché. 14. They deny us because we think like free people, and free thinking is forbidden. 15. The Cyberpunk has no single outer appearance. Cyberpunks are people, starting from the ordinary and known to no one, to the artistic technomaniac, to the electronically-inclined musician, to the open-minded scientist. 16. Cyberpunk isn’t simply a literary genre anymore; it isn’t even an ordinary subculture. Cyberpunk is a stand-alone new culture. The offspring of the new age. A culture that unites our common interests and views. We are a unit. We are Cyberpunks. 1. The Society surrounding us is clogged with conservancy, pulling everything and everybody to itself, while it sinks slowly into the quicksand of time. 2. However doggedly some refuse to believe it, we obviously live in a sick society. The so-called “reforms” our governments so adeptly use to boast are nothing but small steps forward when leaps are possible. 3. People fear the new and unknown. They prefer the old, the familiar and checked truths. They are afraid of what new possibilities can bring. They are afraid that they will lose what they have. 4. Their fear is so intense that they have proclaimed the revolutionary a foe and the free idea its weapon. That’s their fault. 5. People must leave this fear behind and move forward. What’s the point of clinging to the little you have now when you can have more tomorrow? They must stretch out their hands and embrace the new: give freedom to thoughts, ideas, and words. 6. For centuries, each generation has been brought up is the same pattern, taught ideology that everyone follows blindly. Individuality is forgotten. People think alike, following the clichés drilled into them in as children: and when one dares to defy authority, he is punished and held up as a bad example, “Here is what happens to you when you express yourself and deny your teacher’s opinion.” 7. Our society is sick and needs healing. The cure is a change in the System… 1. The System, centuries-old, exists on principles that no longer stand up to scrutiny, a System that has changed little since its conception. 2. The System is wrong. 3. The System must impose its truth upon us so that it can rule. The government needs us to follow it blindly. For this reason, we live in an informational eclipse. When people can only acquire information from the government, they cannot distinguish right from the wrong. So the lie becomes a truth – truth, fundamental to everything else. Thus, leaders control with lies and ordinary people have no notion of what is true and follow the government blindly, trusting it. 4. We fight for freedom of information. We fight for freedom of speech and press. We fight for the freedom to express our thoughts freely, without being persecuted by the System. 5. Even in the most developed and ‘democratic’ countries, the System imposes misinformation. Even in the countries that pretend to be the cradle of free speech, misinformation is the System’s primary weapon. A weapon they use very well. 6. It is the Net that helps us spread information freely. The Net, with no boundaries or information limit. 7. What is ours is yours, what is yours is ours. 8. Everyone can share information without restrictions. 9. Encryption of information is our weapon. Thus the words of revolution can spread uninterrupted, and the government remains in the dark. 10. The Net is our realm. In the Net, we are kings. 11. The world is changing, even if slowly, but the laws remain the same. The System isn’t changing. For centuries the laws have remained the same. Just a few details are adjusted to the modern times, but everything conceptually remains the same. 12. We need new laws. Laws fitting the times we live in, fitting the world that surrounds us. Not laws built on the basis of the past. Laws built for today, laws that will fit tomorrow. 13. These laws only limit us. These laws need revision, badly. 1. Some people don’t care about global events. They care only about what happens around them in their micro-universe. 2. These people can only see a dark future, for they can only see the life they live now in this messed up world. 3. Others show concern about global affairs. Interested in everything: in the future, in perspective, and in what’s going to happen globally. 4. They have a more optimistic view. For them the future is cleaner and beautiful – Utopia. They look into future and see a more mature man, a wiser world. 5. We are in-between. We are interested in what happens now, but also in what’s going to happen tomorrow. 6. We look into the Net, and the Net is only growing more expansive. 7. Soon everything in this world will be swallowed by the Net, from military systems to home computers. 8. But the Net is a house of anarchy. 9. The Net can’t be controlled and in this is its power. 10. Every man will be dependent on the Net. 11. The whole of mankind’s information will be there, locked in the abyss of zeros and ones. 12. Those who control the Net, control the information. 13. We live in a mixture of past and present. 14. The bad comes from man, and the good comes from technology. 15. The Net will control the little man, and we will control the Net. 16. What you don’t control, will control you. 17. Information is POWER! 1. Where are we? 2. We all live in a sick world where hatred is a weapon and freedom is a dream 3. The world develops so slowly. It is hard for a Cyberpunk to live in an underdeveloped world, watching the people around him and seeing how wrongly they develop 4. We move forward; they pull us back again. Society suppresses us. Yes, it suppresses freedom of thought. With its cruel education programs in schools and universities. They drill into children their view of things and any attempt to express a different opinion is denied and punished. 5. Our kids grow, educated in this old and still unchanged System. A System that tolerates no freedom of thought and demands strict obedience to the rules. 6. In what a different world we could we live if people were making leaps and not creeps. 7. It’s so hard to live in this world, Cyberpunk. 8. It’s as if time has stopped. 9. We live in the right spot, but not the right time. 10. Everything is so ordinary. People are all the same, their deeds too. It’s as if Society feels an imperative to live in the past. 11. Those trying to find their own world, the world of the Cyberpunk, build a new world. Built in their thoughts, it changes reality. It lays over the current world, and thus they live in a virtual world. Thought-space, built upon reality. 12. Others simply get accustomed to the world as it is. They continue to live in it, although they dislike it. They have no other choice but to bear the hope that the world will get out of its rut and will move forward. 13. We are working to change the situation. We are working to adjust the present world to our needs and views, to maximally use what is fit and to ignore the trash. Where we can’t, we just live in this world, like Cyberpunks, no matter how hard. When society fights us, we fight back. 14. We build our worlds in Cyberspace. 15. Among the zeros and ones, among the bits of information. 16. We build our community. The community of Cyberpunks.  Unite! Fight for your rights! We are the Electronic Minds, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks. We live in Cyberspace. We are everywhere. We know no boundaries. This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks’ Manifest.

They care only about what happens around them in their micro-universe. Tell me, do you known people that act differently from this? This *is* what a human does currently.  Humans have this (now recently unmasked) weakness – being limited in scope to caring about the destiny of maybe 100 people. It is a major weakness – it simply does not scale right now We are largely fucked if we keep relying on current inherent human-ness: -our built-in thought patterns -our knee-jerk reactions -human rationalizations optimized for the past -human general senses optimized for the past -human brain paths optimized for the past We are in big trouble – exploring space and beyond requires more than a “locally optimized” intelligence. -we have to be changing/optimizing “ourselves” for any hope of survival.   Isaac L. Wheeler (Veritas)   March 18, 2017, 6:24 pm  I think that the goal is to attempt to set these biases aside, but also to accept that we, as imperfect beings, will never be able to entirely do so.

(Source: Cyberpunk Mag 2004, Artist- de4m) It was Valentine’s Day in 1997. Many of us were already cemented in our love of cyberpunk and cyber-culture was in full swing. Then came A Cyberpunk Manifesto by Kristiyan Kirchev. I was only just discovering the genre at this time and reading this document during my formative years has transformed my world view, just as The Hacker Manifesto aka The Conscience of a Hacker (1986) did for the generation that came before. A Cyberpunk Manifesto (1997) also entered the cyberpunk consciousness in the wake of John Perry Barlow’s A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace (1996), only reinforcing the importance of cyber-rights and the need to fight for them. Since these manifestos and calls-to-action were made in the mid-80s and 90s, our digital rights have been slowly eroded away, and now nearly 20 years since A Cyberpunk Manifesto made its impact on the youth of a generation, it seems like a good time to re-examine A Cyberpunk Manifesto in the shadow of our post-9/11 world. By Christian A. Kirtchev We are the Electronic Minds, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks. We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries. This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks’ manifest. 1. We are those, the Different. Technological rats, swimming in the ocean of information. 2. We are the retiring, little kid at school, sitting at the last desk, in the corner of the class room. 3. We are the teenager everybody considers strange. 4. We are the student hacking computer systems, exploring the depth of his reach. 5. We are the grown-up in the park, sitting on a bench, laptop on his knees, programming the last virtual reality. 6. Ours is the garage, stuffed with electronics. The soldering iron in the corner of the desk and the nearby disassembled radio – they are also ours. Ours is the cellar with computers, buzzing printers and beeping modems. 7. We are those that see reality in a different way. Our point of view shows more than ordinary people can see. They see only what is outside, but we see what is inside. That’s what we are – realists with the glasses of dreamers. 8. We are those strange people, almost unknown to the neighborhood. People, indulged in their own thoughts, sitting day after day before the computer, ransacking the net for something. We are not often out of home, just from time to time, only to go to the nearby radio shack, or to the usual bar to meet some of the few friends we have, or to meet a client, or to the backstreet druggist… or just for a little walk. 9. We do not have many friends, only a few with whom we go to parties. Everybody else we know we know on the net. Our real friends are there, on the other side of the line. We know them from our favorite IRC channel, from the News-Groups, from the systems we hang-around. 10. We are those who don’t give a shit about what people think about us, we don’t care what we look like or what people talk about us in our absence. 11. The majority of us likes to live in hiding, being unknown to everybody except those few we must inevitably contact with. 12. Others love publicity, they love fame. They are all known in the underground world. Their names are often heard there. But we are all united by one thing – we are Cyberpunks. 13. Society does not understand us, we are “weird” and “crazy” people in the eyes of the ordinary people who live far from information and free ideas. Society denies our way of thinking – a society, living, thinking and breathing in one and only one way – a cliche. 14. They deny us for we think like free people, and free thinking is forbidden. 15. The Cyberpunk has outer appearance, he is no motion. Cyberpunks are people, starting from the ordinary and known to nobody person, to the artist-technomaniac, to the musician, playing electronic music, to the superficial scholar. 16. The Cyberpunk is no literature genre anymore, not even an ordinary subculture. The Cyberpunk is a stand-alone new culture, offspring of the new age. A culture that unites our common interests and views. We are a unit. We are Cyberpunks. In the first section of A Cyberpunk Manifesto, Kirchev asserts who is “cyberpunk.” A cyberpunk is anyone, according to Kirchev, who is a free thinker, technologically inclined, and identifies as cyberpunk. This kind of free-thinking and nerdy-technological endeavor can leave us on the fringes of society. But it is all of us – hackers, coders, makers, artists, authors, musicians, scholars, and philosophers – who make up the cyberpunk culture. We are united by shared love of media, shared heroes, shared interests, and even fashion. It is hard to dispute that the cyberpunk subculture has only grown in the 20 years since the inception of A Cyberpunk Manifesto. 1. The Society which surrounds us is clogged with concervacy pulling everything and everybody to itself, while it sinks slowly in the quicksands of time. 2. However doggedly some refuse to believe it, it is obvious that we live in a sick society. The so called reforms which our governments so adeptly use to boast, are nothing else but a little step forward, when a whole jump can be done. 3. People fear the new and unknown. They prefer the old, the known and checked truths. They are afraid of what the new can bring to them. They are afraid that they can lose what they have. 4. Their fear is so strong that it has proclaimed the revolutional a foe and the free idea – its weapon. That’s their fault. 5. People must leave this fear behind and go ahead. What’s the sense to stick to the little you have now when you can have more tomorrow. Everything they must do is stretch their hands and feel for the new; give freedom to thoughts, ideas, to words: 6. For centuries each generation has been brought up is a same pattern. Ideals is what everybody follows. Individuality is forgotten. People think in a same way, following the cliche drilled in them in childhood, the clichc-education for all children: And, when someone dares defy authority, he is punished and given as a bad example. “Here is what happens to you when you express your own opinion and deny your teacher’s one”. 7. Our society is sick and need to be healed. The cure is a change in the system…. In the second section of A Cyberpunk Manifesto, Kirchev asserts the problems that our society faces. First,”conservancy,” in a political sense, is the tendency towards stasis and tradition or evening moving back in time to a more traditional set of values. This conservancy, then, is an obstacle to the change that Kirchev, and many cyberpunks, want to see. Second, oppressive governments and institutions use fear to dissuade the kind of critical, radical, revolutionary action that is necessary to bring change to a strongly rooted system. It is the duty, then, of any free-thinking individual to challenge authority in all spheres to ensure that the authorities power is not being abused and to push society in the direction of positive change that benefits all, rather than a small, powerful minority. This part of A Cyberpunk Manifesto is more relevant today, than the day it was written. In the wake of 2011’s Occupy Protests worldwide, there is no denying that there is a global disenfranchised population that is being ruled by an oligarchical class, many of which are unelected and have no responsibility to represent the majority. The rise of Anonymous in the image of Alan Moore’s V, from V for Vendetta, is indicative of the growing awareness of collective action, which has been empowered by cyberspace. 1. The System. Centuries-old, existing on principles that hang no more today. A System that has not changed much since the day of its birth. 2. The System is wrong. 3. The System must impose its truth upon us so that it can rule. The government needs us follow it blindly. For this reason we live in an informational eclipse. When people acquire information other that that from the government, they cannot distinguish the right from the wrong. So the lie becomes a truth – a truth, fundamental to everything else. Thus the leaders control with lies and the ordinary people have no notion of what is true and follow the government blindly, trusting it. 4. We fight for freedom of information. We fight for freedom of speech and press. For the freedom to express our thoughts freely, without being persecuted by the system. 5. Even in the most-developed and ‘democratic’ countries, the system imposes misinformation. Even in the countries that pretend to be the cradle of free speech. Misinformation is one of the system’s main weapon. A weapon, they use very well. 6. It is the Net that helps us spread the information freely. The Net, with no boundaries and information limit. 7. Ours is yours; yours is ours. 8. Everyone can share information; no restrictions. 9. Encrypting of information is our weapon. Thus the words of revolution can spread uninterrupted, and the government can only guess. 10. The Net is our realm. In the Net we are Kings. 11. Laws. The world is changing, but the laws remain the same. The System is not changing, only a few details get redressed for the new time, but everything in the concept remains the same. 12. We need new laws. Laws, fitting the times we live in, with the world that surrounds us. Not laws build on the basis of the past. Laws, build for today, laws that will fit tomorrow. 13. The laws that only refrain us. Laws that badly need revision. In the third section of A Cyberpunk Manifesto, Kirchev asserts that information is the key to the control of “The System.” This is really a post-modern argument and fits nicely with a genre, cyberpunk, that is considered post-modern as well. By controlling the information available to people, an entity can construct a version of reality that reinforces the status quo. When information, read factual information, is available to the public, then they can construct their own subjective realities that are closer to objective truth. Access to this kind of information acts as a foil to the misinformation and propaganda perpetuated by governments and other powerful institutions that have agendas. This remains true today, as it did 20 years ago, but especially in the last year, we have seen the power of competing fictional narratives alongside factual information. It is a cyberpunk’s duty more so today to be discerning of information. Encryption, our weapon, has come under attack in recent years as well. Anonymity and encryption are weapons that we all need to learn to use and teach others to use in a society that is under constant surveillance. In the 90s we “knew” we were being watched, but post-Snowden we know we are being watched. Laws are unfortunatly how change is achieved within any governmental system. We need laws that punish cyber-crimes fairly. We need laws that do not criminalize curiosity. We need laws that do not stifle innovation. These laws can only be brought into existence if we by collective action, make them materialize. This section of A Cyberpunk Manifesto feels prescient. 1. Some people do not care much about what happens globally. They care about what happens around them, in their micro-universe. 2. These people can only see a dark future, for they can only see the life they live now. 3. Others show some concern about the global affairs. They are interested in everything, in the future in perspective, in what is going to happen globally. 4. They have a more optimistic view. To them the future is cleaner and more beautiful, for they can see into it and they see a more mature man, a wiser world. 5. We are in the middle. We are interested in what happens now, but what in what’s gonna happen tomorow as well. 6. We look in the net, and the net is growing wide and wider. 7. Soon everything in this world will be swallowed by the net: from the military systems to the PC at home. 8. But the net is a house of anarchy. 9. It cannot be controlled and in this is its power. 10. Every man will be dependent on the net. 11. The whole information will be there, locked in the abysses of zeros and ones. 12. Who controls the net, controls the information. 13. We will live in a mixture of past and present. 14. The bad come from the man, and the good comes from technology. 15. The net will control the little man, and we will control the net. 16. For is you do not control, you will be controlled. 17. The Information is POWER! In the fourth section of A Cyberpunk Manifesto, Kirchev asserts an optimistic vision of the future of the internet and society. It asserts that there are three groups – controllers, free-thinkers, and the controlled. It asserts that control will be wrested from the hands of the controllers into the hands of the free thinkers and that the controlled will then be better off for it. The battle is still raging, corporations and governments have more power over the internet now than they have ever had, and there seems no end in sight. But it also true that the internet can never really be controlled, as a population can never really be controlled. Through collective action, we stopped SOPA, PIPA, ACTA, and possibly even the TPP. It is important to remember that this war will never be over. Governments and institutions will always be grappling for more power to subvert the will of the people (assuredly for their own good). It is a cyberpunk’s responsibility to subvert them right back and to be ever vigilant. 1. Where are we? 2. We all live in a sick world, where hatred is a weapon, and freedom – a dream. 3. The world grows so slowly. It is hard for a Cyberpunk to live in an underdeveloped world, looking the people around him, seeing how wrongly they develop. 4. We go ahead, they pull us back again. Society suppressses us. Yes, it suppresses the freedom of thought. With its cruel education programs in schools and universities. They drill in the children their view of things and every attempt to express a different opinion is denied and punished. 5. Our kids grow educated in this old and still unchanged system. A system that tolerates no freedom of thought and demands a strict obeyance to the reules… 6. In what a worlds, how different from this, could we live now, if people were making jumps and not creeps. 7. It is so hard to live in this world, Cyberpunk. 8. It is as if time has stopped. 9. We live on the right spot, but not in the right time. 10. Everything is so ordinary, people are all the same, their deeds toos. As if society feels an urgent need to live back in time. 11. Some, trying to find their own world, the world of a Cyberpunk, and finding it, build their own world. Build in their thoughts, it changes reality, lays over it and thus they live in a virtual world. The thought-up, build upon reality. 12. Others simply get accustomed to the world as it is. They continue to live in it, although they dislike it. They have no other choice but the bare hope that the world will go out of its hollow and will go ahead. 13. What we are trying to do is change the situation. We are trying to adjust the present world to our needs and views. To use maximally what is fit and to ignore the trash. Where we can’t, we just live in this world, like Cyberpunks, no matter how hard, when society fights us we fight back. 14. We build our worlds in Cyberspace. 15. Among the zeros and ones, among the bits of information. 16. We build our community. The community of Cyberpunks. Unite! Fight for your rights! We are the Electronic Minds, a group of free-minded rebels. Cyberpunks. We live in Cyberspace, we are everywhere, we know no boundaries. This is our manifest. The Cyberpunks’ Manifest. February 14, 1997 Christian A. Kirtchev Oh, how little things have changed since 1997. Our world has only gotten sicker. Income inequality has steadily increased pushing more and more people into low paying service positions, while more and more jobs are assumed by machines. In addition, we are under increased surveillance every day. The digital freedoms that we have enjoyed since the inception of the Internet are under constant assault. In cyberspace, among the zeroes and ones, we have built our community. We have built our own world. We will continue to unite and to fight for our rights. We are cyberpunks. In 2017, so little has changed from a political perspective. The same problems that Kirchev identified remain problems today. The biggest difference between 2017 and 1997 seems to be the public consciousness of the issues that we face, and this explains the resurgence of cyberpunk in the popular consciousness. Technology has become more ubiquitous, and the Internet of Things has begun to blur the lines between cyberspace and reality, as has Augmented Reality. We live in a more cyberpunk world every day, perhaps we can still steer this ship in the right direction.   Jeff Wolfe   January 11, 2017, 2:35 pm  Fantastic work bringing this back with commentary. I love all the work on the site.   Isaac L. Wheeler (Veritas)   January 12, 2017, 4:20 am  Thanks, Jeff. We thought it would be a good way to explore the content as well, especially conisdering how relevant it remains. Pingback: A Cyberpunk Manifesto - Revised with Original Author | Neon Dystopia   Anon   September 27, 2017, 9:46 pm  Nice post with some interesting insights. I happened upon this post while searching for a book Kirtchev published in 2010 titled Electronic Minds. Anyone know where I’d be able to read it? Apparently the book is largely about the cyberpunk manifesto and explores the same ideas in a greater depth.   Isaac L. Wheeler (Veritas)   September 28, 2017, 3:12 am  Thanks for the kind words. Electronic Minds is a facinating read and does explore in greater depth some of the ideas presented in the Cyberpunk Manifesto, but it also goes into some interesting ideas about artificial intelligence and the human relationship with technology that border on the supernatural.
