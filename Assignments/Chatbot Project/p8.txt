I guess my subjective notion of cyberpunk didn't match the objective one of Sterling. I felt the collection was loosely tied together by, perhaps, mere fancy on Sterling's part... time travel, goth, space, computers, etc. This summarizes my opinion. Believe it or not, I referenced your review as I was reading the stories.  And as you see, I generally agree.  Yes, not every one is what most consider cyberpunk, leaving me to believe Sterling obviously had his own agenda.  If you haven't already, watch a few interviews or presentations on youtube.  The man's a unique individual, to say the least, so it doesn't surprise me that Greg Bear or Rudy Rucker's tales made the collection.  Given the intro is heavy on the artistic side, I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt that something lurks in those stories related to cyberpunk even if it is not readily obvious.
