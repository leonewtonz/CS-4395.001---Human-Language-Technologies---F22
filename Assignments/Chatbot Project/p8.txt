We stumble out of yet another sleepless night on the tail of end of a night shift, eyes aching and brain buzzing. How long has it been? Months? Years? We boot up the vid screen either way, craving sweet release, ramming the smooth metal of the connector jack into our eye holes for smooth and seamless data transference. We see you, arriving at at another Last Week Cyberpunk where the sky itself almost sold us things we never needed, where a report confirms what reality we are living in, and where there oh so many fresh games to upload into your sweet headmeat. Strap in, light up, and I’ll see you at the bottom. This visual is so blade runner I can’t even. Projecting the words “SimpleCola”, this image was taken from a promotional video from StartRocket When Russian startup StartRocket said it wanted to use swarms of mini satellites called cubesats in order to project advertising images in low orbit, there’s one company that apparently perked up with interest: PepsiCo. Despite many others reacting with disgust at the idea, PepsiCo spokesperson Olga Mangova said “We believe in StartRocket potential. Orbital billboards are the revolution on the market of communication.” Well, maybe they believe in them less than they thought, because PepsiCo has reportedly already begun walking back those statements. “We can confirm StartRocket performed an exploratory test for stratosphere advertisements using the Adrenaline GameChangers logo,” a spokesperson for PepsiCo told Gizmodo. “This was a one-time event; we have no further plans to test or commercially use this technology at this time.” If they had partnered together, StartRocket reported they thought they could put up an ad for one of their drinks, Adrenaline Rush, as early as 2021. Once StartRocket finds an advertiser who actually wants to follow through, they’d make the ad work by stringing small synchronized satellites called CubeSats, that once in position would unfurled reflective mylar sails to bounce the Sun’s light back to Earth, spelling things like “KFC”. Naturally, there has been a lot of pushback with this brand of commercialism. Space experts raise concerns about space debris pollution, and astronomer John Barentine asked the obvious question of “who wants to look at this?” Nonetheless, Barentine thinks this kind of marketing is inevitable, since there are no laws against space ads, and once one company does it, he thinks many others will follow suit. Space is, after all, the final frontier in terms of prime real estate. That’s right, we’re looking at this story through the lens of Cyberpunk and noticing some truly genre-matching elements to it. Concepts that you’d originally find only in Cyberpunk tales, such as government hackers and botnet propaganda networks, are now very much reality. What’s more, they’re mainstream enough to influence major elections. Mueller reported that Russia used social media, hackers, and other sophisticated systems to help try to influence the 2016 election. Russian operatives working for an organization called Internet Research Agency created Facebook and Twitter accounts that reached millions (including Trump himself and his family) by creating pro-Trump, anti-Clinton shareable memes, messages and images. Meanwhile, other operatives were hacking into the Democratic party servers to steal info and release it through WikiLeaks, using usernames such as DCLeaks and Guccifer. And how did they finance the entire operation? By mining Bitcoin. Go figure. Cyberpunk is Now.Cyberpunk BooksRichard Morgan Returns with Graphic novel Altered Carbon: Download BluesMorgan has partnered with Dynamite comics to take his Altered Carbon story to Graphic Novel format with a new novel called Download Blues. Spanning 120 pages, Morgan reportedly kept the noir style which allowed a fair bit of introspection of the characters, while keeping the pulse of the story much higher. The story is due to hit the stores May 28th, but if you can’t wait until then, check out this 9-page preview along with SyFyWire’s interview with Morgan here.Atlas AloneWhile Emma Newman‘s newest entry into her Planetfall series looks to be more space opera than cyberpunk, the inclusion of nuclear warfare and a heavy emphasis on hyperrealistic virtual reality screams high tech, low life. Determine for yourself if this is cyberpunk enough for you:Six months after she left, Dee is struggling to manage her rage toward the people who ordered the nuclear strike that destroyed Earth. She’s trying to find those responsible, but she’s not getting very far alone. A dedicated gamer, Dee is endeavoring to discover a mersive good enough to enable her to escape her trauma. When she is approached by a designer who asks her to play test his new game, she hopes it will be what she needs—but it isn’t like any mersive she’s played before. When a man suddenly dies in the real world, she realizes that at the same time in the game, she killed a character who bears a striking resemblance to the dead man—a man she discovers was one of those responsible for the death of millions on Earth. Disturbed, but thinking it must be a coincidence, Dee continues the hunt for information. But when she finds out the plans for the future colony, she realizes that to save what is left of humanity, she might have to do something that risks what remains of her own.Atlas Alone was released last Tuesday through Ace Books, and can be found here.Tabletop GamesLimited Edition Shadowrun Gaming Sets Now AvailableBreak out your credsticks and get ready to throw your nuyen at the screen, chummers. In honor of the excellent Shadowrun tabletop gaming series’ 30th anniversary, Catalyst Game Labs has whipped up an exclusive treat for its most diehard fans: Shadowrun-themed dice sets, embossed, (faux-)leather-bound sourcebooks at a reduced price, and some pretty kickass lapel pins. Haven’t started running the shadows just yet? No worries–along with these new deals, you can get every Shadowrun sourcebook ever published, all of which can be found here. But stay frosty and remember: the dice, pins, and hardcover sourcebooks are only around for as long as supplies last.Video GamesKatana Zero: On Steam and the Nintendo eShop The time has finally come, friends, to step into the geta of a psychic samurai assassin and cause fast-paced, Hotline Miami–esque mayhem. After a long, long wait, developer Askiisoft and publisher Devolver Digital‘s stylish cyberpunk neo-noir was released on April 18th, and early reviews are largely positive, praising the game’s use of strategic mechanics, clever incorporations of popular video game tropes as in-world plot elements, and an impressive retrofuturistic aesthetic.Playing as an unnamed hitman for a shadowy organization, Katana Zero’s story centers around a drug that gives users the ability to perceive time in a supernatural manner–you are one of these addicts, using the drug in combat to predict the outcome of your choices during your assignments. But how long will it take before your perception of time and reality collapses altogether? Also, you can go into bullet time, block shots with your sword, and paint the walls with the blood of your enemies as you slice your way through 10 levels with razor precision, which looks hella badass. If you haven’t gotten Katana Zero yet, you can do so for Mac and PC through the Steam marketplace and the Nintendo eShop. Sigma Theory Also released on April 18th, the new turn-based political strategy game from Mi-Clos and Goblinz Studios puts you at the helm of a futuristic cold war. While Sigma Theory has been anticipated for some time now, the details concerning the game have been sparse until now. As the developers put it:In the near future, a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery looms over the world, promising radical new technologies. The world’s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality. However, this discovery — called “The Sigma Theory” — can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country’s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else. To achieve this you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world’s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge. It’s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.Sigma Theory can be found on Steam and GOG.com for PC, Mac, and Linux right friggin’ now.Whispers of a Machine Rocking the classic point-and-click adventure look, Raw Fury‘s freshly-minted Whispers of the Machine seems to have come out of nowhere but comes as a pleasant surprise. Described as a “Sci-Fi Nordic Noir”, Clifftop Games and Faravid Interactive‘s collaborative effort follows Vera, a cyborg detective in a post-AI world as she unravels a mystery surrounding a series of connected murders. Looking like Beneath a Steel Sky on nootropics, the game features full voice acting and presents a vision of the future I don’t think any of us have quite seen before. You want it as badly as we do? You can download Whispers of a Machine through Steam or GOG.com right now. Geeksos In a future where a gaming corporation (we’re looking at you, EA) holds the most sway over society, it’s up to you to fight back against the tyranny of irl loot boxes, endless sequels, and DLC for every unfinished product. Steppe Hare Studio brings this world to life in Geeksos, a top-down stealth shooter that offers players endless customization, augmentation upgrades, beautifully crafted scenery dripping with classic aesthetics, and a little bit of the old ultraviolence. Ironically, the game was released on April 16th through Steam Early Access, but considering its $4 price tag, we say give this indie dev a little love and help them prevent the dystopian parody future they’ve predicted.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

I really like how your actions level up one of three personality types, and that in turn seamlessly changes how things play out. I like Vera but the characters are generally quite bland and there’s a sluggish pace and lack of hard narrative hooks, leaving it feeling less engaging than it should be.I still recommend it, though, and have a good feeling it’ll really pick up as the game goes on; there’s some great groundwork so far.

Geeksos In a future where a gaming corporation (we’re looking at you, EA) holds the most sway over society, it’s up to you to fight back against the tyranny of irl loot boxes, endless sequels, and DLC for every unfinished product. Steppe Hare Studio brings this world to life in Geeksos, a top-down stealth shooter that offers players endless customization, augmentation upgrades, beautifully crafted scenery dripping with classic aesthetics, and a little bit of the old ultraviolence. Ironically, the game was released on April 16th through Steam Early Access, but considering its $4 price tag, we say give this indie dev a little love and help them prevent the dystopian parody future they’ve predicted.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

In honor of the excellent Shadowrun tabletop gaming series’ 30th anniversary, Catalyst Game Labs has whipped up an exclusive treat for its most diehard fans: Shadowrun-themed dice sets, embossed, (faux-)leather-bound sourcebooks at a reduced price, and some pretty kickass lapel pins. Haven’t started running the shadows just yet? No worries–along with these new deals, you can get every Shadowrun sourcebook ever published, all of which can be found here. But stay frosty and remember: the dice, pins, and hardcover sourcebooks are only around for as long as supplies last.Video GamesKatana Zero: On Steam and the Nintendo eShop The time has finally come, friends, to step into the geta of a psychic samurai assassin and cause fast-paced, Hotline Miami–esque mayhem. After a long, long wait, developer Askiisoft and publisher Devolver Digital‘s stylish cyberpunk neo-noir was released on April 18th, and early reviews are largely positive, praising the game’s use of strategic mechanics, clever incorporations of popular video game tropes as in-world plot elements, and an impressive retrofuturistic aesthetic.Playing as an unnamed hitman for a shadowy organization, Katana Zero’s story centers around a drug that gives users the ability to perceive time in a supernatural manner–you are one of these addicts, using the drug in combat to predict the outcome of your choices during your assignments. But how long will it take before your perception of time and reality collapses altogether? Also, you can go into bullet time, block shots with your sword, and paint the walls with the blood of your enemies as you slice your way through 10 levels with razor precision, which looks hella badass. If you haven’t gotten Katana Zero yet, you can do so for Mac and PC through the Steam marketplace and the Nintendo eShop. Sigma Theory Also released on April 18th, the new turn-based political strategy game from Mi-Clos and Goblinz Studios puts you at the helm of a futuristic cold war. While Sigma Theory has been anticipated for some time now, the details concerning the game have been sparse until now. As the developers put it:In the near future, a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery looms over the world, promising radical new technologies. The world’s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality. However, this discovery — called “The Sigma Theory” — can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country’s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else. To achieve this you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world’s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge. It’s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.Sigma Theory can be found on Steam and GOG.com for PC, Mac, and Linux right friggin’ now.Whispers of a Machine Rocking the classic point-and-click adventure look, Raw Fury‘s freshly-minted Whispers of the Machine seems to have come out of nowhere but comes as a pleasant surprise. Described as a “Sci-Fi Nordic Noir”, Clifftop Games and Faravid Interactive‘s collaborative effort follows Vera, a cyborg detective in a post-AI world as she unravels a mystery surrounding a series of connected murders.

April 24, 2019                  Copyright © 2018 Neondystopia.comWHAT IS CYBERPUNK?ARCHIVETHE TEAMJOIN USABOUTCONTACT The time has finally come, friends, to step into the geta of a psychic samurai assassin and cause fast-paced, Hotline Miami–esque mayhem. After a long, long wait, developer Askiisoft and publisher Devolver Digital‘s stylish cyberpunk neo-noir was released on April 18th, and early reviews are largely positive, praising the game’s use of strategic mechanics, clever incorporations of popular video game tropes as in-world plot elements, and an impressive retrofuturistic aesthetic. Playing as an unnamed hitman for a shadowy organization, Katana Zero’s story centers around a drug that gives users the ability to perceive time in a supernatural manner–you are one of these addicts, using the drug in combat to predict the outcome of your choices during your assignments. But how long will it take before your perception of time and reality collapses altogether? Also, you can go into bullet time, block shots with your sword, and paint the walls with the blood of your enemies as you slice your way through 10 levels with razor precision, which looks hella badass. If you haven’t gotten Katana Zero yet, you can do so for Mac and PC through the Steam marketplace and the Nintendo eShop. Sigma Theory Also released on April 18th, the new turn-based political strategy game from Mi-Clos and Goblinz Studios puts you at the helm of a futuristic cold war. While Sigma Theory has been anticipated for some time now, the details concerning the game have been sparse until now. As the developers put it:In the near future, a paradigm-shifting scientific discovery looms over the world, promising radical new technologies. The world’s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality. However, this discovery — called “The Sigma Theory” — can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country’s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else. To achieve this you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world’s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge. It’s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.Sigma Theory can be found on Steam and GOG.com for PC, Mac, and Linux right friggin’ now.Whispers of a Machine Rocking the classic point-and-click adventure look, Raw Fury‘s freshly-minted Whispers of the Machine seems to have come out of nowhere but comes as a pleasant surprise. Described as a “Sci-Fi Nordic Noir”, Clifftop Games and Faravid Interactive‘s collaborative effort follows Vera, a cyborg detective in a post-AI world as she unravels a mystery surrounding a series of connected murders. Looking like Beneath a Steel Sky on nootropics, the game features full voice acting and presents a vision of the future I don’t think any of us have quite seen before. You want it as badly as we do? You can download Whispers of a Machine through Steam or GOG.com right now. Geeksos In a future where a gaming corporation (we’re looking at you, EA) holds the most sway over society, it’s up to you to fight back against the tyranny of irl loot boxes, endless sequels, and DLC for every unfinished product. Steppe Hare Studio brings this world to life in Geeksos, a top-down stealth shooter that offers players endless customization, augmentation upgrades, beautifully crafted scenery dripping with classic aesthetics, and a little bit of the old ultraviolence. Ironically, the game was released on April 16th through Steam Early Access, but considering its $4 price tag, we say give this indie dev a little love and help them prevent the dystopian parody future they’ve predicted.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

Back in January CNN broke the story of alleged re-education (read: concentration) camps that the Chinese government were placing Muslim Uyghur minorities in (China’s government prefers the term ‘vocational training center’). Numbers are unclear, but from 800,000 to possibly 2 million Uyghurs may have been detained in camps that the Chinese foreign ministry is refuting as “complete lies told with ulterior motives”. But leaks are getting out, like one Mihrigul Tursun who told a tale of detention and torture to the US Congressional Executive Commission on China in 2018. The Uyghurs who have experienced being in the camps describe the experience as “cultural genocide”, with camps giving forced lessons on Communist party propaganda coupled with region-wide bans on Uyghur customs and traditions. In early January, Chinese authorities led a carefully supervised tour to show some activities in these centers, where the inmates were seen taking Mandarin lessons, painting, dancing, and singing the song “if you’re happy and you know it clap your hands”. What happened to Tursun, you ask? Well, she was returning to China from Egypt with her eight-week-old triplets when the authorities stopped her for questioning. After they took away her babies and detained her for 3 months, she was told upon her release that one of her sons died in an operation. They gave her no explanations as to why they took her babies, or why they needed to put in a hospital, or why they had scars at the base of their necks. They then took away her passport and kept a watchful eye on her. Two years later, they returned to take her to the concentration camp. Inmates ranged from 17 to 62 years of age, and the camp was so crowded people had to take turns sleeping and standing. Finally, Tursun was able to get released with the help of the US government. But if only the problems were as simple as that. There were later reports that Uyghurs were being offered “free health checkups” except that all that was done was a blood collection, without telling the patients what their results were. This week, an exiled Uyghur oncology surgeon from Urumqi decided he had to speak out on what was happening in the concentration centers. Enver Tohti recalls when he was called to remove a liver and two kidneys from an executed prisoner. Except the prisoner wasn’t dead yet. The Chinese execution squad had shot him through the right of his chest so he would have time to remove the organs while the man was still alive, in order to keep the organs fresh. He was to remove the organs without any anesthetic, too. That happened in 1995. Years later, he released how widespread and systematic this process had become, and in 1998 worked with a British media company to report on how cancer rates were spiking among Uyghur workers who were laboring in a Nuclear testing facility. Tohti believes that this practice of organ harvesting sprang from a strong demand from wealthy Saudis. According to him, demand far outweighs supply, which would explain the compulsory blood sample collections from Uyghurs, to create a “live organ-matching database”. After all, according to the director of Saudi Center for Organ Transplants Dr. Shaheen, 410 Saudis had purchased organs from black markets in China, Egypt, and Pakistan. And according to the European Parliament’s public health committee, illegally harvested kidneys can go for as much as USD $165,000 each. It’s now possible to see signs on the floor of airports such as in Xinjiang that gives priority access to people transporting human organs. There is little else more dystopian that I can think of than this kind of government-sanctioned DNA database of Uyghurs to allow for the systematic incarceration for human organ harvesting and all kinds of other torture than this story. As journalist CJ Werleman points out in his article covering this story, “These crimes against humanity are every bit as horrific as they are unimaginable, but given Uyghur activists have described to me and many others how Uyghur Muslims detained in concentration camps are being subjected to gang rapes, sterilization programs, systematic torture, forced marriage to Han Chinese citizens, forced disappearances and executions, there’s every reason to believe claims of live-organ harvesting barely scratch the surface of what is the largest cultural genocide of Muslims in modern times.” According to a report from Bloomberg that comes as a surprise to no one, Amazon representatives and employees have admitted to listening in on the private conversations and intimate moments of those who own Alexa-powered smart devices. While the official statement by an Amazon spokesperson claims that most interactions with Alexa are kept private and select clips are transcribed and forwarded to reviewers to “improve the customer experience”. Similar to the process experienced by Facebook moderators (although the abuse is suffered less by employees and distributed to the users’ privacy), hundreds or possibly thousands of Amazon employees across the globe are tasked with listening to short audio samples in order to improve Alexa’s voice recognition software, which, y’know, Amazon neglected to tell its customers on the AI’s FAQ page. While users can choose to opt out of their personal recordings being analyzed by these reviewers through Alexa’s privacy settings (for now), clips are allegedly only stored after users activate their devices, and the selected clips’ user information is not shared with employees, no additional safeguards have been put in place to protect user identity, unlike Google, which distorts their Google Assistant users’ voices. Additionally, Amazon employees have admitted to receiving intimate, disturbing, or “possibly criminal” clips, such as a child crying out for help or a woman singing in her shower, which have either been captured as background noise or due to errors in Alexa’s voice recognition. In some cases, clips depicting potential sexual assaults have been captured but gone unreported to the authorities because “it wasn’t Amazon’s job to interfere”, which is the kind of atrociously apathetic response that’s to be expected from a megacorporation. Those of you who are not concerned by the fact that complete strangers have access to personal details that you would rather not be made public might be thinking something along the lines of, “Who cares if some pencil pusher on another continent can hear me after I rub one out on the couch and passes it around to their coworkers? At least there’s still some level of anonymity. All Amazon wants to do is get me to buy things I don’t need.” This is valid for the time being, but all it takes is one addendum to the Patriot Act (or equivalent “anti-terrorist” laws outside the U.S.) in order for the switch on your smart assistant’s microphone to be locked into the on position and all your audio recordings to be seizable by the NSA, adding to the ever-growing list of 1984-style eyes and ears that, at times, you might forget are there. This is especially jarring because personal assistants are designed with a voice recognition range that surpasses that of phone and laptop microphones. Should some law under the pretense of flushing out illegal immigrants be passed, all it could take is one out-of-context conversation or one night of experimentation with illicit substances to land yourself on a government watchlist at the very best. If you or someone you know happens to own an Amazon Echo or another smart device, make sure to keep on your toes, because someone may be listening in. It has been announced by a court in England that that the operator of Silk Road 2, Dread Pirate Roberts 2 (DPR2), is technologist and privacy activist Thomas White who has been now sentenced to 5 years and 4 months in prison. The arrest of White occurred in 2014, but England’s strict reporting rules on court cases prevented any type of information leaking out. White, up till now, had been out on bail since his arrest in 2014 and had under his real name developed a reputation in cyber security circles and became familiar under the moniker ‘The Cthulhu,.’, and a was regular source (again, using his real name) in several news articles as an expert in security and Tor related subjects. White pleaded guilty to crimes while operating Silk Road 2 including drug trafficking, money laundering, and the creation of child pornography. Paul Chowles, an investigator from the National Crime Agency (NCA) who worked on the case, stated that White had in his possession the private encryption key belonging to Dread Pirate Roberts 2 that is a strong indication White is DPR2. White’s motivation, Chowles believes, was a mix of financial gain and power. To check out the full story, go here. Julian Assange Arrested in LondonThe founder of Wikileaks was arrested last thursday in London by British police, allowed in by the Ecuadorian ambassador. Assange was formally charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer.” Jen Robinson, Assange’s lawyer, also confirmed he is also facing extradition to the US due to breach of bail conditions and his involvement with Chelsea Manning. If sent to the US, he will surely suffer the same fate as her. To clear a few things up, the allegation that he helped Chelsea Manning crack a password isn’t new. The Obama administration had know about it for a long while but decided not to pursue Assange as it would be a brutal blow to freedom of the press. Trump does not seem to have such problems. The second thing that’s been flying around, the allegation that Assange helped Manning hack into DOJ databases she had no valid access to, is false, as the actual accusing documents state that Assange helped her make a new username to access the DOJ to keep her anonymity (which, legally, isn’t hacking). Assange was helping his source keep her identity secret, and every good journalist does not reveal his sources for doing so would put them at risk. Assange being arrested puts all journalists and seekers of the truth at risk. This shows that everyone can be touched, and that the Powers that Be don’t care about the truth. I am in no position to dispute claims that Assange is a past rapist and a generally shitty person. I’m sure he probably is and deserves a circle stomp for it. BUT, what his arrest represents puts everyone who wants the truth in danger. Wikileaks exposed war crimes, and told us tales of wrongdoing the US government didn’t want to share to the world out of fear of reckoning (which, I fear, despite exposure, the reckoning never came). What he did (not who he is) is important and deserves defending. Wikileaks is big, Assange is big, Chelsea Manning is big, but authority can always decided to turn their attention on those who are much smaller and guilty of much smaller slights. Like calling the president a motherfucker. Trump? You’re a motherfucker. Fuck you, you Press hating piece of shit.This saga is long, complex, and far too big to cover in LWIC in the detail it deserves. For a wonderful and in depth analysis (and the source of much of the information here), check out this article. Video GamesNintendo Puts Labo VR Kit on MarketAs we hoped and feared, it turns out that Nintendo had plans all along for those latent VR capabilities that a hacker uncovered in the Switch’s source code a few months back. Having just released a new line of Labo kits that essentially operate in a manner similar to Google Cardboard, Nintendo recently announced it has plans to update Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in order to give them virtual reality capabilities.Unfortunately, for the time being the VR kits have the typical side effect of dizziness and headaches when worn for too long, which is commonly associated with cheaper headsets, and no VR-exclusive games have been released for the console yet. However, the basic kit is only $40, which marks it as the most affordable major player in the virtual reality industry, and foreshadows great things to come for the Switch and future Nintendo consoles. If you’d like to see the genesis of the future Ready Player One predicted for yourself, you can get a Nintendo Labo VR kit here.Bot Vice: Now on Nintendo Switch Speaking of the Nintendo Switch, fans of gallery shooters and ’90s-era family-friendly video games, rejoice! Bot Vice, DYA Games’ tribute to MegaMan-style video games, has just been ported to the Nintendo Switch as of April 10th. As Erin Saver, ex-cop turned cyborg vigilante, you’ll have to blast your way to the top of the Tominaka Plaza building before the nefarious Wildbots, a gang of genetically and cybernetically altered beasts, reduce it to rubble. With 40 minutes on the clock and 25 levels (more, if you include the game’s bonus levels), Bot Vice is a fast-paced, hyperactive shoot-em-up from start to finish. If you own a Switch and enjoy the retro aesthetic, you can get yourself a digital copy here for 10 USD.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

Assange was formally charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with “conspiracy to commit computer intrusion for agreeing to break a password to a classified U.S. government computer.” Jen Robinson, Assange’s lawyer, also confirmed he is also facing extradition to the US due to breach of bail conditions and his involvement with Chelsea Manning. If sent to the US, he will surely suffer the same fate as her. To clear a few things up, the allegation that he helped Chelsea Manning crack a password isn’t new. The Obama administration had know about it for a long while but decided not to pursue Assange as it would be a brutal blow to freedom of the press. Trump does not seem to have such problems. The second thing that’s been flying around, the allegation that Assange helped Manning hack into DOJ databases she had no valid access to, is false, as the actual accusing documents state that Assange helped her make a new username to access the DOJ to keep her anonymity (which, legally, isn’t hacking). Assange was helping his source keep her identity secret, and every good journalist does not reveal his sources for doing so would put them at risk. Assange being arrested puts all journalists and seekers of the truth at risk. This shows that everyone can be touched, and that the Powers that Be don’t care about the truth. I am in no position to dispute claims that Assange is a past rapist and a generally shitty person. I’m sure he probably is and deserves a circle stomp for it. BUT, what his arrest represents puts everyone who wants the truth in danger. Wikileaks exposed war crimes, and told us tales of wrongdoing the US government didn’t want to share to the world out of fear of reckoning (which, I fear, despite exposure, the reckoning never came). What he did (not who he is) is important and deserves defending. Wikileaks is big, Assange is big, Chelsea Manning is big, but authority can always decided to turn their attention on those who are much smaller and guilty of much smaller slights. Like calling the president a motherfucker. Trump? You’re a motherfucker. Fuck you, you Press hating piece of shit.This saga is long, complex, and far too big to cover in LWIC in the detail it deserves.

Video GamesNintendo Puts Labo VR Kit on MarketAs we hoped and feared, it turns out that Nintendo had plans all along for those latent VR capabilities that a hacker uncovered in the Switch’s source code a few months back. Having just released a new line of Labo kits that essentially operate in a manner similar to Google Cardboard, Nintendo recently announced it has plans to update Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in order to give them virtual reality capabilities.Unfortunately, for the time being the VR kits have the typical side effect of dizziness and headaches when worn for too long, which is commonly associated with cheaper headsets, and no VR-exclusive games have been released for the console yet. However, the basic kit is only $40, which marks it as the most affordable major player in the virtual reality industry, and foreshadows great things to come for the Switch and future Nintendo consoles. If you’d like to see the genesis of the future Ready Player One predicted for yourself, you can get a Nintendo Labo VR kit here.Bot Vice: Now on Nintendo Switch Speaking of the Nintendo Switch, fans of gallery shooters and ’90s-era family-friendly video games, rejoice! Bot Vice, DYA Games’ tribute to MegaMan-style video games, has just been ported to the Nintendo Switch as of April 10th. As Erin Saver, ex-cop turned cyborg vigilante, you’ll have to blast your way to the top of the Tominaka Plaza building before the nefarious Wildbots, a gang of genetically and cybernetically altered beasts, reduce it to rubble. With 40 minutes on the clock and 25 levels (more, if you include the game’s bonus levels), Bot Vice is a fast-paced, hyperactive shoot-em-up from start to finish. If you own a Switch and enjoy the retro aesthetic, you can get yourself a digital copy here for 10 USD.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

The Obama administration had know about it for a long while but decided not to pursue Assange as it would be a brutal blow to freedom of the press. Trump does not seem to have such problems. The second thing that’s been flying around, the allegation that Assange helped Manning hack into DOJ databases she had no valid access to, is false, as the actual accusing documents state that Assange helped her make a new username to access the DOJ to keep her anonymity (which, legally, isn’t hacking). Assange was helping his source keep her identity secret, and every good journalist does not reveal his sources for doing so would put them at risk. Assange being arrested puts all journalists and seekers of the truth at risk. This shows that everyone can be touched, and that the Powers that Be don’t care about the truth. I am in no position to dispute claims that Assange is a past rapist and a generally shitty person. I’m sure he probably is and deserves a circle stomp for it. BUT, what his arrest represents puts everyone who wants the truth in danger. Wikileaks exposed war crimes, and told us tales of wrongdoing the US government didn’t want to share to the world out of fear of reckoning (which, I fear, despite exposure, the reckoning never came). What he did (not who he is) is important and deserves defending. Wikileaks is big, Assange is big, Chelsea Manning is big, but authority can always decided to turn their attention on those who are much smaller and guilty of much smaller slights. Like calling the president a motherfucker. Trump? You’re a motherfucker. Fuck you, you Press hating piece of shit.This saga is long, complex, and far too big to cover in LWIC in the detail it deserves.

Video GamesNintendo Puts Labo VR Kit on MarketAs we hoped and feared, it turns out that Nintendo had plans all along for those latent VR capabilities that a hacker uncovered in the Switch’s source code a few months back. Having just released a new line of Labo kits that essentially operate in a manner similar to Google Cardboard, Nintendo recently announced it has plans to update Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in order to give them virtual reality capabilities.Unfortunately, for the time being the VR kits have the typical side effect of dizziness and headaches when worn for too long, which is commonly associated with cheaper headsets, and no VR-exclusive games have been released for the console yet. However, the basic kit is only $40, which marks it as the most affordable major player in the virtual reality industry, and foreshadows great things to come for the Switch and future Nintendo consoles. If you’d like to see the genesis of the future Ready Player One predicted for yourself, you can get a Nintendo Labo VR kit here.Bot Vice: Now on Nintendo Switch Speaking of the Nintendo Switch, fans of gallery shooters and ’90s-era family-friendly video games, rejoice! Bot Vice, DYA Games’ tribute to MegaMan-style video games, has just been ported to the Nintendo Switch as of April 10th. As Erin Saver, ex-cop turned cyborg vigilante, you’ll have to blast your way to the top of the Tominaka Plaza building before the nefarious Wildbots, a gang of genetically and cybernetically altered beasts, reduce it to rubble. With 40 minutes on the clock and 25 levels (more, if you include the game’s bonus levels), Bot Vice is a fast-paced, hyperactive shoot-em-up from start to finish. If you own a Switch and enjoy the retro aesthetic, you can get yourself a digital copy here for 10 USD.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

April 16, 2019  As we hoped and feared, it turns out that Nintendo had plans all along for those latent VR capabilities that a hacker uncovered in the Switch’s source code a few months back. Having just released a new line of Labo kits that essentially operate in a manner similar to Google Cardboard, Nintendo recently announced it has plans to update Super Mario Odyssey and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild in order to give them virtual reality capabilities. Unfortunately, for the time being the VR kits have the typical side effect of dizziness and headaches when worn for too long, which is commonly associated with cheaper headsets, and no VR-exclusive games have been released for the console yet. However, the basic kit is only $40, which marks it as the most affordable major player in the virtual reality industry, and foreshadows great things to come for the Switch and future Nintendo consoles. If you’d like to see the genesis of the future Ready Player One predicted for yourself, you can get a Nintendo Labo VR kit here.Bot Vice: Now on Nintendo Switch Speaking of the Nintendo Switch, fans of gallery shooters and ’90s-era family-friendly video games, rejoice! Bot Vice, DYA Games’ tribute to MegaMan-style video games, has just been ported to the Nintendo Switch as of April 10th. As Erin Saver, ex-cop turned cyborg vigilante, you’ll have to blast your way to the top of the Tominaka Plaza building before the nefarious Wildbots, a gang of genetically and cybernetically altered beasts, reduce it to rubble. With 40 minutes on the clock and 25 levels (more, if you include the game’s bonus levels), Bot Vice is a fast-paced, hyperactive shoot-em-up from start to finish.

Through hiccups and crashes and the ever present screeching of white noise we are broadcasting to you from the digital wasteland. We are back to a regular scheduled program and bringing you two weeks worth of news to fill your tired vacant eyeholes with. We are bringing you hacking heroes, weaponized noggins, the latest data leak, social media brain-jacking, and a ton of books and games to keep your brain wired. Dive in! The US army has signed a $480 million contract to use the HoloLens with helmets in the battlefield, and dozens of Microsoft workers are signing a letter in protest. “We are a global coalition of Microsoft Workers, and we refuse to create technology for warfare or oppression” the letter stated. While Microsoft has created tech for the military before, apparently the line had never been crossed into actual weapons development. An additional concern is that the AR overlay would make the battlefield feel more like a simulated video game, which would further distance the soldiers from the harsh realities they are in (therefor, making killing easier). So far, however, it seems like Microsoft is continuing with its plans. The HoloLens 2 was unveiled in Barcelona a couple weeks ago. In an interview between Harvard professor Johnathan Zittrain and Facebook CEO/ wannabe presidential candidate Mark Zuckerberg, the 34-year-old billionaire discussed the role of technology in society and, as usual, the future of Facebook. For the majority of the interview, Zuckerberg addressed concerns regarding the social network’s privacy settings and content in what appears to be a reasonable manner–establishing a doctor-patient confidentiality-esque relationship between the network and its users, encrypting its messaging system more strongly, and other ideas that would give the users more control over their private information. Whether or not Zuckerberg’s proposed solutions were sincere is yet to be seen, but may be influenced by the fact that Facebook hasn’t been doing so hot lately. However, late in the interview, Zuckerberg expressed the need for a “supreme court” of sorts for Facebook that would determine what kinds of content would be allowed to be posted on a case-by-case basis. In a rare moment of humility, he commented that no one person should have the sort of power he’s been given, and that he would not be involved in this proposed judiciary system. Unfortunately, shortly after this segment, the topic of augmented reality came up, in which Zuckerberg divulged that Facebook has been researching brain-computer interfaces. Ideally, this technology would allow Facebook users to interact online and with AR displays quickly by navigating and writing messages simply by thinking. However, Zuckerberg seems to have forgotten where his ludicrous amounts of money have come from–by breaching user privacy without consent, tracking their movements both on and offline, and selling their personal data to corporations, using it for targeted ads, etc. Perhaps Zuckerberg is simply being short-sighted in his grand ambitions, naïvely focusing on the ease of access a device like he described would bring without considering the massive drawbacks. But the threat still remains; if a brain-computer interface device ever hits the market without Facebook radically changing its practices (and you know it won’t) this could potentially leave the individual’s ultimate safe haven–the mind–open to data mining at the least violating end of the spectrum. But that’s a small price to pay for convenience, amirite? TL;DR – if you haven’t jumped ship from Facebook yet, do it before the thought police drag you off for reading subversive material on a deviant website. It comes to the surprise of none that North Korea has been accused of conducting a global hacking campaign yet again. The week before last saw some new information come forward in the form of a security panel held by the UN. Experts state that the attacks (past and present) were carried out by a specialized hacking force, with cybercrime being an important part of the country’s economic policy as digital theft of crypto and foreign currency allows them to circumvent strict economic sanctions. Cryptocurrency is perfect for laundering, as it is removed from any government regulation (or protections), with North Korea racking in $670 million worth of the stuff in 2017 – 2018. Despite having little food and being ruled over by an actual Bond villain, The Hermit Kingdom can sling some serious code it seems. Nikkei obtained a copy of the UN report and goes into much greater detail here. Count this as yet another entry in our long documentation of how your information isn’t safe anywhere online, for the week before last saw the discovery of 150 gigs of plaintext marketing data just sitting around in a MongoDB database. Security researchers Bob Diachenko and Vinny Troia stumbled upon the database, having gone public with their findings. The trove of data contained 763 million unique email address, phone numbers, names, home addresses, genders, social media accounts, and other ‘business intelligence data’ owing to the databases owner, a validations firm called Verifications.io. Validation firms are an important part of digital marketing who verify that a client’s mailing lists are full of real emails and won’t bounce back messages. The data discovered in the database isn’t anything one couldn’t find on their own from various public sources, but amassing it all into one place would be a boon to any crook looking to pull some social engineering scam. Verifications.io went dark quickly when asked about the trove, pulling the information off the net and refusing to answer any questions (like where they are based or who the owner is) causing an already sketchy situation to be even more, well, sketchy. Think this data dump pwned you? Hit up haveibeenpwned.com to see if your information was in the database. You can also read the full article here. The US government, deciding it was tired of having their hacking tools stolen, cut to the chase and released a major security tool for free. Named Ghidra, the tool can’t actually hack anything, but reverse engineers a programs code into something a human can understand. Programs like Ghidra are extremely useful in understanding types of malware and viruses found in the wilds of the internet, making them easier to combat. The program is far from new (which may explain why we are getting it for free), having appeared in lists of CIA and NSA cyber tools as early as 2017. It also isn’t the first program to be released for free (not counting the stuff they just straight-up lost), with Security-Enhanced Linux and Security-Enhanced Android being available to the masses. So do you want to help fight cybercrime like a good little American, or just fuck around with a piece of NSA technology because why not? Download Ghidra here! Releasing such a program into the wide world, however, seems like an interesting choice, as hackers could use it to simply better evade NSA security globally. Only time will tell if this was a smart move, but in the meantime have fun fellow nerds.  China seems to be winning the race of ‘let’s build a fucked up dystopia’ among nations, but this one cements it. Victor Gevers, a Dutch ethical hacker and founder of the nonprofit group GDI.Foundation discovered the unsecured data cache while looking for open databases in China. The database was completely insecure on MongoDB (for there lies the worlds evil apparently) and was quickly taken offline after news of the breach. The information (which appeared in English) contained addresses, ages (ranging from as young as 15 to as old as 95), phone numbers, education locations, ID numbers, marital statuses, and a ‘breedready’ statistic next to them. It’s well know China is currently going through a kind of population skew, with men far outnumbering women in the near future which could explain why such a creepy data collection even exists. The exact origin of the information is unknown or whether it was government collected or part of a dating service (although what dating service would have a 15 year old on it is beyond me), but the collection shows a deeply troubling trend in surveillance within China. Our boy Victor also found a Chinese facial recognition database specifically targeting Muslims (who are being deeply discriminated against in China) in the SenseNets hack. Mr. Grevers is definitely cyberpunk through and through. For a full interview with him and more on China’s developing dystopia go here.  Ridley Scott may have forgotten how to make a good Alien film, but six indie filmmakers have been selected out of more than 550 to show him how it’s done. The shorts were made in partnership with Tongal (a type of online platform to connect creators with brands and filmmakers to crowdsource content) and gave creators full access to the Alien intellectual property. The films will be going live on IGN on March 29 with a new film a week (no Netflix or streaming, unfortunately). The official descriptions of the films are as follow: ALIEN: Alone – Written and Directed by Noah Miller – Hope, an abandoned crew member aboard the derelict chemical hauler Otranto, has spent a year trying to keep her ship and herself alive as both slowly fall apart. After discovering hidden cargo, she risks it all to power up the broken ship in search of human life. ALIEN: Containment – Written and Directed by Chris Reading – Four survivors find themselves stranded aboard a small escape pod in deep space. Trying to piece together the details around the outbreak that led to their ship’s destruction, they find themselves unsure to trust whether or not one of them might be infected. ALIEN: Harvest – Directed by Benjamin Howdeshell – The surviving crew of a damaged deep-space harvester have minutes to reach the emergency evacuation shuttle. A motion sensor is their only navigation tool leading them to safety while a creature in the shadows terrorizes the crew. However, the greatest threat might have been hiding in plain sight all along. ALIEN: Night Shift – Written and Directed by Aidan Breznick – When a missing space trucker is discovered hungover and disoriented, his co-worker suggests a nightcap as a remedy. Near closing time, they are reluctantly allowed inside the colony supply depot where the trucker’s condition worsens, leaving a young supply worker alone to take matters into her own hands. ALIEN: Ore – Written and Directed by the Spear Sisters – As a hard-working miner of a planet mining colony, Lorraine longs to make a better life for her daughter and grandchildren. When her shift uncovers the death of a fellow miner under mysterious circumstances, Lorraine is forced to choose between escape or defying management orders and facing her fears to fight for the safety of her family. ALIEN: Specimen – Directed by Kelsey Taylor – It’s the night shift in a colony greenhouse, and Julie, a botanist, does her best to contain suspicious soil samples that have triggered her sensitive lab dog. Despite her best efforts the lab unexpectedly goes into full shutdown and she is trapped inside. Little does she know, an alien specimen has escaped the mysterious cargo, and a game of cat and mouse ensues as the creature searches for a host. It’s been a long month since the announcement for the new sci-fi anthology series produced by famed directors Tim Miller (whose original intent was to reboot the ’80s cult anthology Heavy Metal) and David Fincher, but the wait is over, friends. In case you missed it, Love, Death + Robots debuted this past Friday, featuring 18 short science fiction and fantasy films from over a dozen different animation and film studios. If you haven’t binged your way through it yet (you can bet that sweet ass of yours we have) artificial intelligence isn’t quite as omnipresent as the title suggests, but between the copious amounts of gore, sex, and fuckwords, there’s enough lowlife mentality to get you by until the next season of Altered Carbon comes out. Love, Death + Robots is now available for streaming on Netflix, so go get your fix, you filthy animals.  Recently on Kickstarter, the film collective MaseBrothers launched a campaign to fund their latest project, Cyborg: Deadly Machine. Looking like a parody of iconic ’80s and early ’90s action films such as The Terminator, The Predator, Robocop, and the cult classic Nemesis, Cyborg: Deadly Machine takes place in a post-apocalyptic world that has been ravaged by cyborg soldiers gone awry. The world’s only hope? A hapless cook who somehow has the ability to kick serious ass. Based on the trailer, it would seem MaseBrothers holds a high degree of fidelity towards the aesthetics of the films they’ve been inspired by, right down to its cassette tracking static and obvious miniature setpieces. In the vein of other cyberpunk parody films such as Kung Fury and Attack of the Cyber Octopuses, Cyborg looks like it’ll be a hell of a lot of fun. Currently, the campaign has hit about 15% of its goal with 23 days left to go, so if you want to see this happen, feel free to donate here. The clonetastic series Orphan Black may be getting a resurrection on AMC as a spin-off series taking place within the same universe. Variety reports that there are currently talks to bring back the five season series with Temple Street Productions producing again. It’s still unknown whether the original cast will return, or this will tell another story with Tatiana Maslany’s Sarah Manning. The change is definitely unusual, with the show being rebooted on a completely different network. We will keep you punks posted as this develops! It has been confirmed that the manga Spriggan (Striker for those in the States) is getting the Netflix treatment and is being adapted into a new anime series. Spriggan, by Hiroshi Takashige, is about world powers battling in secret over advanced technology left by an ancient race of beings while following the main character, Yu Ominae, and his work for the ARCAM Corporation who try and keep the artifacts from being misused. The new series will be animated by David Productions (Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure), but right now there is limited information as to who else is involved. If you’re a fan of the manga (or the 1998 movie like I am) then you know this new anime will be filled with cyborgs, secret government psy-op programs, super humans, and a whole lotta guns. You ever wake up in a back alley and discover someone has weaponized your head? No? Well that’s the plot of No Gun Life where our protagonist, Inui Juuzou, is a former “Extends” soldier who has been heavily modified to be a dangerous weapon with no memory of who he was or why someone would turn his head into a gun. The news came from Ultra Jump magazine and according to them it will be produced by Madhouse. The current manga is going on seven volumes, with the eighth having dropped on March 19th. On the eve of the debut of the final film in the Psycho-Pass spinoff trilogy, Sinners of the System, the show’s official website has revealed that a long-awaited third season has been greenlit. The last we’ve seen of Psycho-Pass’ main storyline was way back in 2015 with Psycho-Pass: The Movie, and its development has slowed to a crawl since the first season finished airing in 2013. However, seeing as Psycho-Pass 3 appears to be featuring two brand-new main characters as opposed to the series’ constant, Akane Tsunemori, it may be safe to assume that the series will begin building towards a final conclusion as opposed to maintaining the status quo. No release date has been announced yet, but all the same, here’s hoping Production I.G delivers a high-caliber story for this cyberpunk police procedural rife with snappy one-liners, and meaty explosions.  Entirely shot in France, Osmosis is the latest Cyberpunk thriller coming from Netflix, a la Black Mirror. This 8 episode series is set in the near future where technology can dig deep into a user’s brain in order to find the perfect dating match with 100% accuracy. But does perfect love exist, and if so, at what price? These are the questions that the producers apparently want to answer. Coming March 29th, I’ll be excited to see another take on the future of online dating after Hang the DJ.  What happens when you combine Cyberpunk with Robin Hood? Why, Sherwood of course! Having premiered already on March 6th, Sherwood is a CG adventure set in a dystopian 23rd century London. In it, a 14 year old hacker named Robin fights with a band of renegades to take down the mad Sheriff of Nottingham. Featuring 10 episodes, the series female lead Robin uses technology, instead of a bow and arrows, to fight back. Hitting all the right Cyberpunk notes with some great-looking visuals, this looks like an excellent addition to the Cyberpunk library. You can watch Sherwood online on YouTube with a YouTube Red subscription. Looks like science fiction anthologies are hotter than the newest cyberdecks these days, as every major publisher seems to be dropping a new one on a near-weekly basis. The latest, a yearly anthology released by St. Martin’s Press on February 26th, may cover the broader spectrum of science fiction and read like a greatest hits album, but since cyberpunk author Pat Cadigan is on the roster, we’ve decided it deserves a shout-out. For decades, the Year’s Best Science Fiction has been the most widely read short science fiction anthology of its kind. Now, after thirty-five annual collections comes the ultimate in science fiction anthologies. In The Very Best of the Best, legendary editor Gardner Dozois selects the finest short stories for this landmark collection, including short fiction from authors such as Charles Stross, Michael Swanwick, Nancy Kress, Greg Egan, Stephen Baxter, Pat Cadigan, and many many more. The last collection edited by the late Gardner Dozois, The Best of the Best promises at least a little bit of cyberpunk action between all the space lasers and time travelers, as it falls within the margins of spec-lit’s shift towards the themes explored by Neuromancer, Blade Runner, and other classics over the last 35 years. If you’re into it, you can get yourself a copy here. The sequel to last year’s One Way, author S.J. Morden continues his hard-boiled series revolving around a corporate space prison that sounds like a mix between Alien, The Martian, and a good old-fashioned noir. While the premise sounds like it might lean a little more towards the space opera side of sci-fi, there are enough cyberpunk earmarks to fall on our radar. They were sent to build a utopia, but all they found on Mars was death. Frank Kitteridge has been abandoned. But XO, the greedy—and ultimately murderous—corporate architects of humanity’s first Mars base made a costly mistake when they left him there: they left him alive. Using his skills and his wits, he’s going to find a way back home even if it kills him. Little does he know that Mars isn’t completely empty. Just over the mountain, there’s another XO base where things are going terribly, catastrophically wrong. And when the survivors of that mission find Frank, they’re going to want to take even the little he has away from him. If there’s anything in Frank’s favor, it’s this: he’s always been prepared to go to the extremes to get the job done. That’s how he ended up on Mars in the first place. It just might be his ticket back. No Way was published on February 26th through Orbit Books, and you can get it here. While admittedly not cyberpunk, author K. Chess’ science fiction tale of displacement in a world facing a refugee crisis (albeit the refugees come from a nuked-out parallel world) is highly reminiscent of Philip K. Dick’s own use of social satire–particularly that of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? and The Man in the High Castle. Wherever Hel looks, New York City is both reassuringly familiar and terribly wrong. As one of the thousands who fled the outbreak of nuclear war in an alternate United States–an alternate timeline–she finds herself living as a refugee in our own not-so-parallel New York. The slang and technology are foreign to her, the politics and art unrecognizable. While others, like her partner Vikram, attempt to assimilate, Hel refuses to reclaim her former career or create a new life. Instead, she obsessively rereads Vikram’s copy of The Pyronauts–a science fiction masterwork in her world that now only exists as a single flimsy paperback–and becomes determined to create a museum dedicated to preserving the remaining artifacts and memories of her vanished culture. But the refugees are unwelcome and Hel’s efforts are met with either indifference or hostility. And when the only copy of The Pyronauts goes missing, Hel must decide how far she is willing to go to recover it and finally face her own anger, guilt, and grief over what she has truly lost. This new release from Tin House Books has been up for grabs since March 5th, which you can get here, if you’re so inclined. Published by FSG Originals, Tim Maughan‘s newest novel seems to take an unconventional approach to cyberpunk worldbuilding, portraying a utopian, anarchic subculture that exists in the digital realm of near-future Britain alongside a digital apocalypse. Here are the deets: BEFORE: In Bristol’s center lies the Croft, a digital no-man’s-land cut off from the surveillance, Big Data dependence, and corporate-sponsored, globally hegemonic aspirations that have overrun the rest of the world. Ten years in, it’s become a center of creative counterculture. But it’s fraying at the edges, radicalizing from inside. How will it fare when its chief architect, Rushdi Mannan, takes off to meet his boyfriend in New York City―now the apotheosis of the new techno-utopian global metropolis?AFTER: An act of anonymous cyberterrorism has permanently switched off the Internet. Global trade, travel, and communication have collapsed. The luxuries that characterized modern life are scarce. In the Croft, Mary―who has visions of people presumed dead―is sought out by grieving families seeking connections to lost ones. But does Mary have a gift or is she just hustling to stay alive? Like Grids, who runs the Croft’s black market like personal turf. Or like Tyrone, who hoards music (culled from cassettes, the only medium to survive the crash) and tattered sneakers like treasure.The world of Infinite Detail is a small step shy of our own: utterly dependent on technology, constantly brokering autonomy and privacy for comfort and convenience. With Infinite Detail, Tim Maughan makes the hitherto-unimaginable come true: the End of the Internet, the End of the World as We Know It.Infinite Detail has been out since this past Tuesday, so get yourself a copy while there’s still an internet left to fulfill all your consumerist wants and needs.Blade Runner 2019 AnnouncedHuge news on the comics front: Titan Comics, a relatively new imprint of Titan Books, has recently announced in conjunction with Alcon Entertainment that they will be adapting Ridley Scott‘s magnum opus into a comic series. Not to be confused with Boom! Studios’ more-faithful adaptation of Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? or the Blade Runner anime that is currently in the works, Blade Runner 2019 will take place during the same time period as its source material but will focus on a female blade runner named Ash (pictured above) and focus on a brand new plot and different characters.Toting talent such as Blade Runner 2049 screenwriter Michael Green, Titan Comics’ latest effort displays more ambition than many of their other series, which are typically tie-in comics, continuations of popular video games, movies (including Stieg Larsson’s Millennium), and television series. However, they have owned the rights to countercultural icon Tank Girl since 2008, so if you’ll indulge some speculation, the chances of this becoming the graphic novel equivalent of Blade Runner’s novelized sequels is… Well, it’s still there, but regardless, but we have faith that this could be another chance to tell stories like the animated short Blackout 2022, with potential for noir tropes, retrofuturistic fashion and tech, and tongue-in-cheek self-awareness. After all, you don’t add 2019 to a comic released in 2019 that clearly doesn’t take place in this reality’s 2019 without at least taking a peek behind the fourth wall. Whatever the case, you can rest assured this is going on our reading list, so stay tuned.Video GamesCyberpunk 2077—Playstation’s Interview with the Dev TeamNarrated by none other than Doug Cockle, the voice of Geralt of Rivia himself, this new video takes fans behind the scenes to learn a bit about the development process from the team CD Projekt Red. Although not a deep dive, it did share some interesting facts about their creative process, such as how important it was for the team to release the videogame footage to get confirmation from the fans that they were on the right track. The video also talks about design challenges that came with being able to use a car to get around in Night City, the shift to first person perspective, and the fully customizable feature of the characters which is a big difference from The Witcher 3. Still no release date yet, but us here at the hype mill are still as excited as ever.VirtuaVerse AnnouncedTaking place in a future that blends retrofuturistic cyberpunk with modern science fiction concepts, the new point-and-click adventure game currently being developed by Theta Division looks like one hell of a ride. Sporting cyberpunk iconography down to the nano-augmented marrow, VirtuaVerse’s society is built around an augmented reality network designed by a data-mining AI overlord that seemingly has control over what all of its denizens see through ocular implants–that is, save for the player character, Nathan, who wears an augmented reality headset and is capable of seeing reality for what it is. After Nathan’s girlfriend Jay, an AR graffiti artist, goes missing, Nathan finds himself sucked into a world of technomancers, hackers, virtual reality, and “digital archaeology”. We’re very much looking forward to what that means.No release date has been set yet, unfortunately, but it looks like VirtuaVerse is anticipated for release on PC, Mac, and Linux. Stay frosty–we’ll be sure to keep our AR-implanted eyes on this one.Hypnospace OutlawLongtime readers may remember us covering the overview for the vaporwave-cyberpunk head trip that is Hypnospace Outlaw. Developed by Jay Tholen (aka Tendershoot), Michael Lasch, and ThatWhichIsMedia, Hypnospace Outlaw puts you in the shoes of an Enforcer working for the Hypnospace Patrol Department–the official title for a moderator on the early 1990s’ most aesthetically-displeasing vision of the internet. Rest assured that hijinks in the vein of Jazzpunk‘s style will undoubtedly ensue. Hypnospace Outlaw was released on Steam on March 12th and is available for PC, Mac, and Linux, so strap on your Hypnospace Headband™ and dive into the zany future of the internet superhighway today!Ubermosh Vol. 7Fans of Walter Machado‘s bullet hell hack-and-slasher series, rejoice and prepare your offerings to the great spectacle that is UBERMOSH. Of course, if you’re familiar with the series, you likely already know that the game was released on early access at the end of February. There isn’t much to explain about the game itself–taking place in a distant future in which techno-priests prove their faith by genociding as many enemies as possible in 90-second matches, Ubermosh Vol. 7 brings back its brutal arcade murder sprees and industrial first-wave cyberpunk visuals. Unfortunately, you can’t buy that for a dollar just yet, but Ubermosh 1-6 have been priced down on Steam. You can find each game here.7th SectorAs of March 5th, indie dev Sergey Noskov has made available a platformer called 7th Sector. The trailer above is pretty cryptic and the details about the game are pretty sparse, but it would appear that the player is in the role of a rogue AI of some kind, delving more and more deeply into a cyberpunk cityscape by transferring consciousness between drones in what appears to be side-scrolling puzzle solving similar to that in Playdead‘s works. Most impressively on display is the game’s design, rendering gorgeous, immersive environments. If you want a slice of this pie, pick it up here.Blade Symphony: Now Free to Play on SteamIf you’re a fan of PS2-era swordfighting games, today’s your lucky day. Puny Human Games, the minds behind open-source arena shooter Dystopia, have recently opted to slash the price of their cyberpunk fighter down to the press of a button. Perhaps this is due to the game’s thinning community, or a recent update interfering with its mechanics, resulting in a deluge of bad reviews. But don’t let that put you off–despite the game’s current state, when in working order it’s pretty fun.

The beautiful sound of genetic engineering fills your data streams as we upload a new batch of weekly data packets into your headmeat. In this Last Week in Cyberpunk genetic engineering is indeed going down (who owns it is another matter), some more books to keep your aforementioned headmeats healthy, and a new show on Netflix is going to teach us about the three most important things in life via animation. The EU has concluded its talks and have created the final version of the Copyright Directive, saving the best of the worst for last in this final document. It’s been 18 years since the Directive has been overhauled, with previous iterations giving artists and scientists much needed protections: artists were protected from not getting ripped off from entertainment companies, and scientists were allowed to use copyrighted work in their studies or to analyze. Both of these, however, have been defanged to the point of uselessness in favor of corporate exploitation of art and the holding back of science.Under this directive all online communities, platforms, or service that have existed for more than 3 years and makes €10,000,001 or more a year must ensure that no user posts anything that infringes copyright in any way (so your clever memes would be illegal along with this entire site, whoops). This is, of course, not possible by any stretch of the word and would require companies to spend many a euro in developing automated copyright filters that may not work and may be discriminatory. Plus, any quote or link taken from a news story and put somewhere else must be licensed no matter what, devastating any form of proper news sources.It’s now up to members of the European Parliament to decide whether to vote on this hot mess or not. Good luck trying to form a campaign around this stellar idea, it being hated by small business and even human rights groups an all. Time will tell how this will end, but if you aren’t a big fan of this and you live in Europe hit up this petition to try and stop this madness here.Predictive Policing: The Path to a Biased Police StateIn a recent article from Boing Boing by co-editor Cory Doctorow, the flaws in recent technological developments related to law enforcement have been called out. Predictive policing, the hot new trend among bootlickers, is based around plugging criminal activity into an evolving algorithm that ideally would be able to accurately predict when and where future crimes are likely to occur, a cruder version of the tech seen in Minority Report and Psycho-Pass. Of course, it might work a lot better if certain police forces weren’t, y’know, adhering to the outdated institution of racism and being criminally violent about it.Due to these biases in the computing process along with the Blue Wall of Silence, experts Rashida Richardson, Jason Schultz, and Kate Crawford assert that this egregious human error will further marginalize minorities living in low-income communities by essentially teaching predictive policing programs to target areas where corrupt law enforcement goes looking for criminal activity, a practice that has fueled the racist policies of the so-called “War on Drugs.”This makes the future of our current police state look more like the one anticipated in Dredd than that of Psycho-Pass, but the result is the same: groups of already-oppressed individuals will find no reprieve from an unrelenting system that chooses to make them the “bad guys,” compounding withheld rage for fear of the repercussions that will inevitably feed into an unending cycle of violence. But hey, if the computer says the data’s right, who’s gonna argue?If you’d like to read Richardson, Schultz, and Crawford’s academic paper covering this subject, you can find it here.Academics vs Mega-Institute: Patent battle over CRISPR rages onImage credit: Ernesto del Aguila III, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIHIn Orphan Black come to life, the battle over who owns the intellectual property for the most powerful gene-editing technology in existence continues to rage. The main contenders are scientists at UC Berkeley and The Broad Institute, a mega research institute which includes the likes of MIT and Harvard. On Friday of last week, the US Patent and Trademark office issued a “notice of allowance” signaling that it will be issuing a patent requested by UC Berkeley. This cuts to the heart of the ongoing battle over who owns the patent for CRISPR technology.Although researchers at UC Berkeley first developed the technology and received a patent in 2012, The Broad Institute developed and patented the use of CRISPR in plant and animal cells in 2014. Since then, a protracted, convoluted patent battle has raged on. In 2018, the Patent Office upheld The Broad Institute’s patent, but this didn’t end or even simplify the battle over who owns the rights to CRISPR. As of 2017, the gene-editing patent landscape contained 80 different patents with CRISPR claims. To make things more complicated, while the US Patent Office has favored The Broad Institute, European patent offices did not, citing a lack of novelty in The Broad Institute’s work.For now, the soon to be issued patent will cover the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in any cellular or non-cellular environment. This means that any company wanting to use CRISPR will likely need to acquire licenses from both The Broad Institute and UC Berkeley. Based on their previous efforts, The Broad Institute is unlikely to take this lying down and the academic vs institute patent battle rages on. Who owns this powerful technology may determine who owns your genes and the ability to change them in the not-too-distant future.First in Body Gene-Editing a Tentative SuccessImage credit: Zinc finger motif, Wikimedia, Thomas SplettstoesserIf you’re like me, you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for results to start coming in for a number of human gene-editing trials currently underway. While CRISPR is the most notorious, other gene-editing techniques using zinc finger nucleases delivered by a virus may actually prove to be more promising for use in body. The techniques for gene-editing therapies emerging on the market today involve taking stem cells out of a patient, gene-editing them in a controlled lab setting, allowing them to multiply and then replacing the edited stem cells in the patient. This kind of therapy only works if the problem genes are expressed only in stem cells. If the gene of interest isn’t primarily expressed in stem cells, therapy would need to be attempted in the human body, a far cry away from the ideal controlled lab setting.One such daring attempt is being performed by researchers at Sangamo. Eight patients with Hunters syndrome and three patients with Hurlers syndrome are enrolled in a clinical trial are being given the first in-body gene editing. We’re finally getting results from the study and so far it looks like the gene-editing therapy is safe and the DNA is functioning properly. It’s too early to tell how well the gene-editing therapy works, but the results are promising. The ability to edit genes in-body is a huge step towards the dark gene-editing future we both fear and dream about.Cyberpunk MediaMoviesAlita Filmmakers Give Young Amputee New Bionic ArmsIn a story that gives us cyberpunks here flashbacks to Deus Ex, the producing team at Alita: Battle Angel decided to surprise Tilly Lockey, an advocate for kids with prosthetics, a new set of bionic hands. At only 15 months of age, Tilly contracted a bad case of meningococcal septicemia, a bacterial infection that she could only survive by having both her hands amputated.Tilly’s story is one of a fighting girl and her relation with technology, acceptance, humanity…sound familiar? When she showed up at the Dorchester Hotel, she thought it was only going to be for another photoshoot. Instead, the crew gifted her with a new set of badass bionic arms. In a short clip on twitter you can see her shaking hands with the crew using her new bionic arms, and making fists in a typical Alita fighting fashion.Because James Cameron is a big fan of Tilly’s, he asked them to work with Open Bionics to create a pair of advanced, affordable prosthetic arms. So now when she gets her bionic ocular implants, we know she’s on the right track to gritty crime-solving a la Deus Ex.See all the pictures, clips, and read more about this awesome heart-warming cyberpunk story here.NSFW animated anthology Love, Death  Robots coming to NetflixIt’s being hailed as “the next best thing since the Animatrix,” and judging by the cut-up slices of what we can glimpse from the trailer, I believe it. The Animatrix was revolutionary and visionary, an amazing mix of different artists and different views connected by the unifying theme of The Matrix as subject content. Love, Death  Robots looks like it’s less thematically connected, but it’s taking the animated anthology concept to the next level, and finding the proper home it deserves on Netflix. Coming from Tim Miller (Deadpool, Terminator: Dark Fate) and David Fincher (Mindhunter), the anthology promises “sentient dairy products, werewolf soldiers, robots gone wild, garbage monsters, cyborg bounty hunters, alien spiders and blood-thirsty demons from hell – all converge in 18 NSFW animated stories.”Check out the teaser trailer for yourself and get back to me, because it’s that good. Go ahead, I’ll wait.Take a look at the variety of different formats here! Just like in Animatrix, we have 2D and 3D formats in both anime and full CGI. Apparently the full list will include 5-15 minute segments broaching the topics of racism, government, war, free will, and human nature, and provided from filmmakers from Hungary, France, Canada, Korea, and more. The anthology will be made available on Netflix March 15th, so this is the next cyberpunk media content to put on your calendars after seeing Alita: Battle Angel this weekend!Alita: Battle Angel Slays on V-DayAbove images by Battle Angel Alita mastermind Yukito KishiroAccording to early reports, the just-released Alita: Battle Angel has topped this year’s Valentine’s Day box office charts, with ticket sales clocking in at $8.7 million, handily beating out simultaneous releases like Happy Death Day 2U and Isn’t It Romantic (gee, hard to imagine why), and gunning for The Lego Movie 2’s current spot at the top of the charts. Including pre-screenings, Alita is on track to make $36-38M through its opening weekend. Of course, this is only a fraction of the film’s budget, which is estimated to be between $165 million and $170 million.So get out there, punks, and show Alita some love, at least out of respect for the kickass manga and OVA that preceded it–the only thing standing between thefilm’s success and another Blade Runner 2049 situation is us, the fans. And, as it turns out, it’s actually pretty faithful to the source material, and there are two potential sequels planned if the film succeeds. But then again, once the corporate execs at Disney gets their coke-dusted mitts on the property, they may choose to sap the series of all creative ambition (so please, you monsters, please sell the rights to a studio that actually gives a shit about something other than money). Whatever the case, Alita: Battle Angel is out here and now–the choice is ultimately yours to experience it.New Terminator Film Title AnnouncedIn a follow-up to the behind-the-scenes look at Terminator 6 from a couple weeks back, accomplished producer James Cameron gave this brief statement to joblo.com:“We’re calling it, Terminator: Dark Fate. That’s our working title right now.”While it may be a bit on-the-nose, at least the term “working title” gives us hope that between now and the film’s expected release date of November 1st a title more nuanced may be inspired. Although, if Cameron’s influence dictated Battle Angel Alita‘s renaming to the slightly clunkier Alita: Battle Angel, perhaps not. Whatever the case, a title’s just a title. What lies in store production-wise is more critical, but at this point in time, those details are being kept pretty tightly under wraps.Also, as a footnote: according to the previously mentioned article, it’s rumored that after Cameron finishes producing Terminator: Dark Fate, he’ll be continuing his trend of tireless effort on expanding the cyberpunk mythos by collaborating with high tech, low life director Neill Blomkamp on a sequel to Alien, a match made in beautiful, cosmic cyber-hell. Whether or not this has any basis in reality is yet to be seen.Chimera StrainFollowing a classic Frankensteinian plot structure, the first film by Maurice Haeem has just been promoted by the recently-dropped trailer. While info on the film is scarce, it appears to be an independent production following Doctor Quint (played by Henry Ian Cusick of Lost fame) as he searches for the cure for a deadly genetic disease through what appears to be replacing failing organs with animal ones, which is possible through new breakthrough Quint makes in biotech. The trailer suggests that Quint will find the cure for this disease, then apply his research to transcending the limitations of the human body, which is enough for us to slap a Neon Dystopia-certified biopunk stamp of approval on the film, premiering in theaters and on demand March 15th.Psycho-Pass SS: Case.3 Ad Spot DropsThe latest news in the ongoing release of the Psycho-Pass spinoff trilogy, Sinners of the System, finds that noted cyberpunk-dabbling anime studio Production I.G has released a new ad spot through the official Psycho-Pass website for Case.3: On the Other Side of Love and Hate.This entry into the series will follow resident badass Shinya Kogami following his flight from a dystopian Tokyo in which privacy is virtually nonexistent and social deviants are locked away as latent criminals. Taking place after the events of the feature film, Case.3 chronicles Kogami’s continued radical activism in a war-torn Southeast Asia upon saving a group of refugees from armed guerillas.Psycho-Pass SS: Case.3 will be released in Japanese theaters on March 8th following the successful debut of Case.1, which premiered in January, and Case.2‘s release on Friday. No news yet on American release dates yet, unfortunately.BooksThe TestPublished on Tuesday through Tor Books, Sylvain Neuvel‘s newest novel may not be strictly cyberpunk, but the description, while brief, suggests dystopia in the vein of ND favorite Black Mirror and addresses the atrocious state of modern bureaucracy surrounding our world’s many refugee crises.Britain, the not-too-distant future. Idir is sitting the British Citizenship Test. He wants his family to belong. Twenty-five questions to determine their fate. Twenty-five chances to impress. When the test takes an unexpected and tragic turn, Idir is handed the power of life and death. How do you value a life when all you have is multiple choice?You can pick up a physical or digital copy of The Test here.Video GamesHyper Jam: Cyberpunk 80’s Visuals, Synthwave Soundtracks, and Arcade-style FunHyper Jam is the latest cyberpunk entry in the video game field that checks all the boxes for classical cyberpunk video game fun. Bit Dragon offers us a nostalgic 80s style arcade brawler where you can choose from one of four characters: Vance, the suave fixer, Max, a military veteran, Ghost, a mysterious night rider, and Yuki, a killer assassin. Unfortunately, the game only offers 6 different maps, and early reviews of the game have described the characters as somewhat indiscernible from each other in-game. After each short round, players can choose power-ups to use for the next round from a pool of available power-ups, and these can then stack in time. In the brawl itself, some high-powered weapons will randomly spawn in the arena, such as futuristic bows, rocket launchers, and a Halo-esque gravity hammer.While not usually one for arcade brawlers, the trailer for this video game is what really made me take notice of this game. Not only are the visuals stunning, but synthwave fans may recognize they use Carpenter Brut in their trailer. A quick look on the early reviews on Steam confirm that many players love the ‘killer synthwave soundtrack’ that plays in the game, which seems to include not only Carpenter Brut but also Dance with the Dead, Meteor, and others.Check out the game trailer here:Hyper Jam is now available on Xbox One, PS4, and Steam.Redo! Now on Early AccessVery exciting news for fans of Blame! and other distant-future cyberpunk properties: indie developerRobson Paiva has just released his debut game, Redo!, on Steam Early Access. In it, players are placed in the shoes of one of the last remaining humans as she searches for another survivor in a post-apocalyptic world plagued by sinister biomachines.Featuring pixel art and metroidvania-style gameplay in a futuristic world of winding metal-and-concrete corridors, Redo! promises a cyberpunk experience that’s familiar but unique. Despite its early access status, reviews confirm that the game is complete. You can get it through Steam right now, or alternatively, through itch.io.

February 16, 2019  The EU has concluded its talks and have created the final version of the Copyright Directive, saving the best of the worst for last in this final document. It’s been 18 years since the Directive has been overhauled, with previous iterations giving artists and scientists much needed protections: artists were protected from not getting ripped off from entertainment companies, and scientists were allowed to use copyrighted work in their studies or to analyze. Both of these, however, have been defanged to the point of uselessness in favor of corporate exploitation of art and the holding back of science. Under this directive all online communities, platforms, or service that have existed for more than 3 years and makes €10,000,001 or more a year must ensure that no user posts anything that infringes copyright in any way (so your clever memes would be illegal along with this entire site, whoops). This is, of course, not possible by any stretch of the word and would require companies to spend many a euro in developing automated copyright filters that may not work and may be discriminatory. Plus, any quote or link taken from a news story and put somewhere else must be licensed no matter what, devastating any form of proper news sources. It’s now up to members of the European Parliament to decide whether to vote on this hot mess or not. Good luck trying to form a campaign around this stellar idea, it being hated by small business and even human rights groups an all. Time will tell how this will end, but if you aren’t a big fan of this and you live in Europe hit up this petition to try and stop this madness here. In a recent article from Boing Boing by co-editor Cory Doctorow, the flaws in recent technological developments related to law enforcement have been called out. Predictive policing, the hot new trend among bootlickers, is based around plugging criminal activity into an evolving algorithm that ideally would be able to accurately predict when and where future crimes are likely to occur, a cruder version of the tech seen in Minority Report and Psycho-Pass. Of course, it might work a lot better if certain police forces weren’t, y’know, adhering to the outdated institution of racism and being criminally violent about it.Due to these biases in the computing process along with the Blue Wall of Silence, experts Rashida Richardson, Jason Schultz, and Kate Crawford assert that this egregious human error will further marginalize minorities living in low-income communities by essentially teaching predictive policing programs to target areas where corrupt law enforcement goes looking for criminal activity, a practice that has fueled the racist policies of the so-called “War on Drugs.”This makes the future of our current police state look more like the one anticipated in Dredd than that of Psycho-Pass, but the result is the same: groups of already-oppressed individuals will find no reprieve from an unrelenting system that chooses to make them the “bad guys,” compounding withheld rage for fear of the repercussions that will inevitably feed into an unending cycle of violence. But hey, if the computer says the data’s right, who’s gonna argue?If you’d like to read Richardson, Schultz, and Crawford’s academic paper covering this subject, you can find it here.Academics vs Mega-Institute: Patent battle over CRISPR rages onImage credit: Ernesto del Aguila III, National Human Genome Research Institute, NIHIn Orphan Black come to life, the battle over who owns the intellectual property for the most powerful gene-editing technology in existence continues to rage. The main contenders are scientists at UC Berkeley and The Broad Institute, a mega research institute which includes the likes of MIT and Harvard. On Friday of last week, the US Patent and Trademark office issued a “notice of allowance” signaling that it will be issuing a patent requested by UC Berkeley. This cuts to the heart of the ongoing battle over who owns the patent for CRISPR technology.Although researchers at UC Berkeley first developed the technology and received a patent in 2012, The Broad Institute developed and patented the use of CRISPR in plant and animal cells in 2014. Since then, a protracted, convoluted patent battle has raged on. In 2018, the Patent Office upheld The Broad Institute’s patent, but this didn’t end or even simplify the battle over who owns the rights to CRISPR. As of 2017, the gene-editing patent landscape contained 80 different patents with CRISPR claims. To make things more complicated, while the US Patent Office has favored The Broad Institute, European patent offices did not, citing a lack of novelty in The Broad Institute’s work.For now, the soon to be issued patent will cover the use of CRISPR-Cas9 in any cellular or non-cellular environment. This means that any company wanting to use CRISPR will likely need to acquire licenses from both The Broad Institute and UC Berkeley. Based on their previous efforts, The Broad Institute is unlikely to take this lying down and the academic vs institute patent battle rages on. Who owns this powerful technology may determine who owns your genes and the ability to change them in the not-too-distant future.First in Body Gene-Editing a Tentative SuccessImage credit: Zinc finger motif, Wikimedia, Thomas SplettstoesserIf you’re like me, you’re on the edge of your seat waiting for results to start coming in for a number of human gene-editing trials currently underway. While CRISPR is the most notorious, other gene-editing techniques using zinc finger nucleases delivered by a virus may actually prove to be more promising for use in body. The techniques for gene-editing therapies emerging on the market today involve taking stem cells out of a patient, gene-editing them in a controlled lab setting, allowing them to multiply and then replacing the edited stem cells in the patient. This kind of therapy only works if the problem genes are expressed only in stem cells. If the gene of interest isn’t primarily expressed in stem cells, therapy would need to be attempted in the human body, a far cry away from the ideal controlled lab setting.One such daring attempt is being performed by researchers at Sangamo. Eight patients with Hunters syndrome and three patients with Hurlers syndrome are enrolled in a clinical trial are being given the first in-body gene editing. We’re finally getting results from the study and so far it looks like the gene-editing therapy is safe and the DNA is functioning properly. It’s too early to tell how well the gene-editing therapy works, but the results are promising. The ability to edit genes in-body is a huge step towards the dark gene-editing future we both fear and dream about.Cyberpunk MediaMoviesAlita Filmmakers Give Young Amputee New Bionic ArmsIn a story that gives us cyberpunks here flashbacks to Deus Ex, the producing team at Alita: Battle Angel decided to surprise Tilly Lockey, an advocate for kids with prosthetics, a new set of bionic hands. At only 15 months of age, Tilly contracted a bad case of meningococcal septicemia, a bacterial infection that she could only survive by having both her hands amputated.Tilly’s story is one of a fighting girl and her relation with technology, acceptance, humanity…sound familiar? When she showed up at the Dorchester Hotel, she thought it was only going to be for another photoshoot. Instead, the crew gifted her with a new set of badass bionic arms. In a short clip on twitter you can see her shaking hands with the crew using her new bionic arms, and making fists in a typical Alita fighting fashion.Because James Cameron is a big fan of Tilly’s, he asked them to work with Open Bionics to create a pair of advanced, affordable prosthetic arms. So now when she gets her bionic ocular implants, we know she’s on the right track to gritty crime-solving a la Deus Ex.See all the pictures, clips, and read more about this awesome heart-warming cyberpunk story here.NSFW animated anthology Love, Death  Robots coming to NetflixIt’s being hailed as “the next best thing since the Animatrix,” and judging by the cut-up slices of what we can glimpse from the trailer, I believe it. The Animatrix was revolutionary and visionary, an amazing mix of different artists and different views connected by the unifying theme of The Matrix as subject content. Love, Death  Robots looks like it’s less thematically connected, but it’s taking the animated anthology concept to the next level, and finding the proper home it deserves on Netflix. Coming from Tim Miller (Deadpool, Terminator: Dark Fate) and David Fincher (Mindhunter), the anthology promises “sentient dairy products, werewolf soldiers, robots gone wild, garbage monsters, cyborg bounty hunters, alien spiders and blood-thirsty demons from hell – all converge in 18 NSFW animated stories.”Check out the teaser trailer for yourself and get back to me, because it’s that good. Go ahead, I’ll wait.Take a look at the variety of different formats here! Just like in Animatrix, we have 2D and 3D formats in both anime and full CGI. Apparently the full list will include 5-15 minute segments broaching the topics of racism, government, war, free will, and human nature, and provided from filmmakers from Hungary, France, Canada, Korea, and more. The anthology will be made available on Netflix March 15th, so this is the next cyberpunk media content to put on your calendars after seeing Alita: Battle Angel this weekend!Alita: Battle Angel Slays on V-DayAbove images by Battle Angel Alita mastermind Yukito KishiroAccording to early reports, the just-released Alita: Battle Angel has topped this year’s Valentine’s Day box office charts, with ticket sales clocking in at $8.7 million, handily beating out simultaneous releases like Happy Death Day 2U and Isn’t It Romantic (gee, hard to imagine why), and gunning for The Lego Movie 2’s current spot at the top of the charts. Including pre-screenings, Alita is on track to make $36-38M through its opening weekend. Of course, this is only a fraction of the film’s budget, which is estimated to be between $165 million and $170 million.So get out there, punks, and show Alita some love, at least out of respect for the kickass manga and OVA that preceded it–the only thing standing between thefilm’s success and another Blade Runner 2049 situation is us, the fans. And, as it turns out, it’s actually pretty faithful to the source material, and there are two potential sequels planned if the film succeeds. But then again, once the corporate execs at Disney gets their coke-dusted mitts on the property, they may choose to sap the series of all creative ambition (so please, you monsters, please sell the rights to a studio that actually gives a shit about something other than money). Whatever the case, Alita: Battle Angel is out here and now–the choice is ultimately yours to experience it.New Terminator Film Title AnnouncedIn a follow-up to the behind-the-scenes look at Terminator 6 from a couple weeks back, accomplished producer James Cameron gave this brief statement to joblo.com:“We’re calling it, Terminator: Dark Fate. That’s our working title right now.”While it may be a bit on-the-nose, at least the term “working title” gives us hope that between now and the film’s expected release date of November 1st a title more nuanced may be inspired. Although, if Cameron’s influence dictated Battle Angel Alita‘s renaming to the slightly clunkier Alita: Battle Angel, perhaps not. Whatever the case, a title’s just a title. What lies in store production-wise is more critical, but at this point in time, those details are being kept pretty tightly under wraps.Also, as a footnote: according to the previously mentioned article, it’s rumored that after Cameron finishes producing Terminator: Dark Fate, he’ll be continuing his trend of tireless effort on expanding the cyberpunk mythos by collaborating with high tech, low life director Neill Blomkamp on a sequel to Alien, a match made in beautiful, cosmic cyber-hell. Whether or not this has any basis in reality is yet to be seen.Chimera StrainFollowing a classic Frankensteinian plot structure, the first film by Maurice Haeem has just been promoted by the recently-dropped trailer. While info on the film is scarce, it appears to be an independent production following Doctor Quint (played by Henry Ian Cusick of Lost fame) as he searches for the cure for a deadly genetic disease through what appears to be replacing failing organs with animal ones, which is possible through new breakthrough Quint makes in biotech. The trailer suggests that Quint will find the cure for this disease, then apply his research to transcending the limitations of the human body, which is enough for us to slap a Neon Dystopia-certified biopunk stamp of approval on the film, premiering in theaters and on demand March 15th.Psycho-Pass SS: Case.3 Ad Spot DropsThe latest news in the ongoing release of the Psycho-Pass spinoff trilogy, Sinners of the System, finds that noted cyberpunk-dabbling anime studio Production I.G has released a new ad spot through the official Psycho-Pass website for Case.3: On the Other Side of Love and Hate.This entry into the series will follow resident badass Shinya Kogami following his flight from a dystopian Tokyo in which privacy is virtually nonexistent and social deviants are locked away as latent criminals. Taking place after the events of the feature film, Case.3 chronicles Kogami’s continued radical activism in a war-torn Southeast Asia upon saving a group of refugees from armed guerillas.Psycho-Pass SS: Case.3 will be released in Japanese theaters on March 8th following the successful debut of Case.1, which premiered in January, and Case.2‘s release on Friday.

Including pre-screenings, Alita is on track to make $36-38M through its opening weekend. Of course, this is only a fraction of the film’s budget, which is estimated to be between $165 million and $170 million. So get out there, punks, and show Alita some love, at least out of respect for the kickass manga and OVA that preceded it–the only thing standing between thefilm’s success and another Blade Runner 2049 situation is us, the fans. And, as it turns out, it’s actually pretty faithful to the source material, and there are two potential sequels planned if the film succeeds. But then again, once the corporate execs at Disney gets their coke-dusted mitts on the property, they may choose to sap the series of all creative ambition (so please, you monsters, please sell the rights to a studio that actually gives a shit about something other than money). Whatever the case, Alita: Battle Angel is out here and now–the choice is ultimately yours to experience it.  In a follow-up to the behind-the-scenes look at Terminator 6 from a couple weeks back, accomplished producer James Cameron gave this brief statement to joblo.com: “We’re calling it, Terminator: Dark Fate. That’s our working title right now.” While it may be a bit on-the-nose, at least the term “working title” gives us hope that between now and the film’s expected release date of November 1st a title more nuanced may be inspired. Although, if Cameron’s influence dictated Battle Angel Alita‘s renaming to the slightly clunkier Alita: Battle Angel, perhaps not. Whatever the case, a title’s just a title. What lies in store production-wise is more critical, but at this point in time, those details are being kept pretty tightly under wraps. Also, as a footnote: according to the previously mentioned article, it’s rumored that after Cameron finishes producing Terminator: Dark Fate, he’ll be continuing his trend of tireless effort on expanding the cyberpunk mythos by collaborating with high tech, low life director Neill Blomkamp on a sequel to Alien, a match made in beautiful, cosmic cyber-hell. Whether or not this has any basis in reality is yet to be seen.  Following a classic Frankensteinian plot structure, the first film by Maurice Haeem has just been promoted by the recently-dropped trailer. While info on the film is scarce, it appears to be an independent production following Doctor Quint (played by Henry Ian Cusick of Lost fame) as he searches for the cure for a deadly genetic disease through what appears to be replacing failing organs with animal ones, which is possible through new breakthrough Quint makes in biotech. The trailer suggests that Quint will find the cure for this disease, then apply his research to transcending the limitations of the human body, which is enough for us to slap a Neon Dystopia-certified biopunk stamp of approval on the film, premiering in theaters and on demand March 15th.  The latest news in the ongoing release of the Psycho-Pass spinoff trilogy, Sinners of the System, finds that noted cyberpunk-dabbling anime studio Production I.G has released a new ad spot through the official Psycho-Pass website for Case.3: On the Other Side of Love and Hate. This entry into the series will follow resident badass Shinya Kogami following his flight from a dystopian Tokyo in which privacy is virtually nonexistent and social deviants are locked away as latent criminals. Taking place after the events of the feature film, Case.3 chronicles Kogami’s continued radical activism in a war-torn Southeast Asia upon saving a group of refugees from armed guerillas. Psycho-Pass SS: Case.3 will be released in Japanese theaters on March 8th following the successful debut of Case.1, which premiered in January, and Case.2‘s release on Friday. No news yet on American release dates yet, unfortunately.  Published on Tuesday through Tor Books, Sylvain Neuvel‘s newest novel may not be strictly cyberpunk, but the description, while brief, suggests dystopia in the vein of ND favorite Black Mirror and addresses the atrocious state of modern bureaucracy surrounding our world’s many refugee crises. Britain, the not-too-distant future. Idir is sitting the British Citizenship Test. He wants his family to belong. Twenty-five questions to determine their fate. Twenty-five chances to impress. When the test takes an unexpected and tragic turn, Idir is handed the power of life and death. How do you value a life when all you have is multiple choice? You can pick up a physical or digital copy of The Test here.  Hyper Jam is the latest cyberpunk entry in the video game field that checks all the boxes for classical cyberpunk video game fun. Bit Dragon offers us a nostalgic 80s style arcade brawler where you can choose from one of four characters: Vance, the suave fixer, Max, a military veteran, Ghost, a mysterious night rider, and Yuki, a killer assassin. Unfortunately, the game only offers 6 different maps, and early reviews of the game have described the characters as somewhat indiscernible from each other in-game. After each short round, players can choose power-ups to use for the next round from a pool of available power-ups, and these can then stack in time. In the brawl itself, some high-powered weapons will randomly spawn in the arena, such as futuristic bows, rocket launchers, and a Halo-esque gravity hammer. While not usually one for arcade brawlers, the trailer for this video game is what really made me take notice of this game. Not only are the visuals stunning, but synthwave fans may recognize they use Carpenter Brut in their trailer. A quick look on the early reviews on Steam confirm that many players love the ‘killer synthwave soundtrack’ that plays in the game, which seems to include not only Carpenter Brut but also Dance with the Dead, Meteor, and others. Check out the game trailer here:  Hyper Jam is now available on Xbox One, PS4, and Steam.  Very exciting news for fans of Blame! and other distant-future cyberpunk properties: indie developerRobson Paiva has just released his debut game, Redo!, on Steam Early Access. In it, players are placed in the shoes of one of the last remaining humans as she searches for another survivor in a post-apocalyptic world plagued by sinister biomachines. Featuring pixel art and metroidvania-style gameplay in a futuristic world of winding metal-and-concrete corridors, Redo! promises a cyberpunk experience that’s familiar but unique. Despite its early access status, reviews confirm that the game is complete. You can get it through Steam right now, or alternatively, through itch.io. Also, if you’re a charitable soul that isn’t broke off your ass, consider backing Robson Paiva’s Patreon–the hard work put into games by indie developers rarely goes adequately rewarded.

Welcome back to another Last Week in Cyberpunk, where the news is hot but the pixels are cold. This time around we bring you updates from the Yellow Vest Protests, a fresh book to upload into your brain meats, and LARPing experience like no other.  An update on the French protests, which are still going on every weekend: Yellow Vest protesters numbered about 21,000 this weekend, which is down a little from previous weeks. An anti-terrorism police car, motorbikes, and multiple trash cans were set on fire, with public cameras and bus stops destroyed as well. On Saturday, some protesters peeled off from the main group, trying to storm the national assembly. One of the protesters picked up a rubber grenade from the riot police to throw back, but the grenade exploded in his hand, seriously injuring the protester. The movement, despite constant action amid shrinking numbers, is becoming internally divided due to disagreements on how to protest, whether to ally with unions, to get further concessions from the government, and where to take the movement further. For the full article go here. Source: Motherboard ATT, T-Mobile, and Sprint customer location data has been continually sold to bounty hunters through a series of third-party companies. One company, CerCareOne, operated from 2012 to 2017, sold this location data to bail-bond firms under the condition that they not reveal the existence of the company to the public. Motherboard had evidence for at least 250 bounty hunters accessing the data through CerCareOne with one bail-bond firm using the service 18,000 times. It’s fair to say that the abuse is fairly widespread. The data being sold is more than a simple ping off of a cell tower, it’s A-GPS or assisted GPS, a precise way to narrow down your location to just a few meters, even inside a building. It’s the information that is supposed to be used to save your life in an emergency, to identify your location to 911 when you aren’t able to, but instead its being sold to private companies with anything but your best interests in mind. No telecom company has denied selling A-GPS data, so it’s safe to assume that if you use a cell phone, you’re not immune. “The scale of this abuse is outrageous,” — Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. For now, CerCareOne has been shut down, however it’s unlikely that it is the only company of its kind out there, so let the game of whack a mole begin. Motherboard’s in-depth article is worth the read, find it here. Source: The Download A new proof-of-concept smart pill could pave the way for delivering injectables (think insulin, hormones and vaccines) via a pill instead of an external jab. Once swallowed, the smart pill orients and attaches itself to the GI tract and injects its payload through the gastric wall. So far this has been demonstrated in animals with insulin. Insulin, like many other “injectables” are too fragile to survive the acidic environment of the stomach and must be injected in order to be effective. In pharmaceutical development, if a drug is unable to be taken orally, it’s considered a serious drawback, if not a nail-in-the-coffin (because who wants to get a shot when they could take a pill?). It often stops development of that drug in its tracks if it can’t be altered to be more stable or more easily absorbed in the stomach. This smart pill has potential to deliver any substance too sensitive to be taken orally, which opens up a world of possibilities for new drugs and new delivery systems. Follow the research here (its behind a paywall but there are ways around those) or get the summarized version from The Download.

By making withdrawals around midnight, Qisheng discovered that the bank’s system did not properly record withdrawals, allowing Qisheng to withdraw money from his account without the total being deducted. Apparently by installing scripts into the system, Qisheng was able to suppress any red flags that would have been risen on the event of a failed transaction, and was able to smuggle seven million Yuan (about one million USD) over a period of fourteen months. Unfortunately for Qisheng, the bank eventually caught wind of the bad code and turned him in to the authorities. Despite the bank’s public protests upon Qisheng’s return of the money, Qisheng is now facing ten years in prison. It would seem his alibi of holding onto the bank’s money as a bit of surreptitious white-hat hacking on the side fell through upon discovering Qisheng had invested some of this money in the stock market. FOX orders AI drama thriller “neXT” pilot from co-creator/executive producer Manny Coto (Star Trek: Enterprise, Dexter) and director/executive producers John Requa and Glenn Ficarra (This Is Us). neXT is being described as fast-paced, fact-based action thriller featuring a paranoid former tech CEO who joins a team to stop a self-improving rogue AI. It will also attempt to examine how technology is infecting our lives in ways we haven’t properly considered and understood yet.Check out the full report here.MoviesAlita: One Last Time Before Theatrical Release (We Promise)Any American football fans among our readership? If so, you might have caught the 30-second ad spot released during the Super Bowl for what will likely be 20th Century Fox’s final ambitious film, which comes out next Thursday. In it we get snippets of the film we haven’t seen yet, but nothing particularly substantial outside a heavier feature of criminal underlord Vector, played by Mahershala Ali.More importantly, however, Fox has uploaded a short behind-the-scenes video that gives us a glimpse into the painstaking process behind crafting Alita’s near-hyperrealistic, lifelike appearance. With commentary provided by Alita’s actor, Rosa Salazar, producers James Cameron and John Landau, and VFX supervisors Mike Cozens, Joe Letteri, Eric Saindon, Richard Baneham, and Nick Epstein, it’s actually kind of amazing to see Weta Digital turn Alita into a character that doesn’t look like she crawled out of the depths of the uncanny valley.Alita: Battle Angel brawls its way into theaters in 3 days at time of publication.BooksA People’s Future of the United StatesReleased on February 5th by Random House, this collection of short stories by spec-lit authors gives us visions of the future that tackle some of the most pressing issues of our time. While the variety ranges from hard sci-fi to fantasy, it looks like there’s enough dystopia in it to interest any cyberpunk. As per usual, the description:A glittering landscape of twenty-five speculative stories that challenge oppression and envision new futures for America—from N. K. Jemisin, Charles Yu, Jamie Ford, G. Willow Wilson, Charlie Jane Anders, Hugh Howey, and more. In these tumultuous times, in our deeply divided country, many people are angry, frightened, and hurting. Knowing that imagining a brighter tomorrow has always been an act of resistance, editors Victor LaValle and John Joseph Adams invited an extraordinarily talented group of writers to share stories that explore new forms of freedom, love, and justice. They asked for narratives that would challenge oppressive American myths, release us from the chokehold of our history, and give us new futures to believe in. They also asked that the stories be badass. The result is this spectacular collection of twenty-five tales that blend the dark and the light, the dystopian and the utopian. These tales are vivid with struggle and hardship—whether it’s the othered and the terrorized, or dragonriders and covert commandos—but these characters don’t flee, they fight. Thrilling, inspiring, and a sheer joy to read, A People’s Future of the United States is a gift for anyone who believes in our power to dream a just world.

BUY IT NOW, CONSUMERIST WAGE SLAVETabletop GamesZone Raiders Kickstarter Fully FundedMiniatures are making a comeback with Fractal Basilisk‘s new, ambitious turn-based strategy game, Zone Raiders. Taking place in the post-singularity world of the Matroshka, players command teams of teched-out humans fighting for survival against an ever-evolving AI menace. With simple rules and bountiful gameplay options, Zone Raiders looks like it’ll be a cozy fit for fans of Tsutomu Nihei, Axiom Verge, and The Matrix trilogy’s desert of the real.While the game itself (as of now) is open source, requiring either a set of custom miniatures or your own collection of sci-fi figurines to play, the rulebook is the current reward for donations of $30 or more. While the campaign has already met its goal, there are still 8 days left to snag yourself a little somethin’ somethin’. You can check out Zone Raiders’ Kickstarter here.CYB_RIf conventional tabletop gaming is more your style, however, we’ve got good news: Kelly Black, an independent tabletop game dev, is currently funding a genre adaptation of Dungeons  Dragons’ fifth edition. Toting a retrofuturistic backdrop and customizability that even allows you to toss in magic elements a la Shadowrun, CYB_R looks like an RPG out of our shiniest dreams and worst nightmares. But don’t take my word for it, here’s the official description:In the shadows of the corporate-owned cities, between the skyscraper headquarters and the luxury hotels, the desperate hone their skills and mod their tech. They seek that elusive edge. Mercenary or motivated, idealistic or just hungry; the street elite infiltrate, invade, and impersonate to make a buck off the giants of industry. This is the story of cybered-up outsiders slipping into the penthouse of dystopian accomplishment uninvited. It’s a retrofuturistic tale of defying the social order, the authorities, and the odds. CYB_R is a cyberpunk genre conversion for DD’s 5th edition, employing bleeding edge rules modifications to allow for cinematic gameplay and leveraging 5th edition’s template-style character building to allow for characters that just seem cool from the get go. Characters are post-future adventurers, pulling gigs for and against the most powerful entities on the globe and they’re looking rad doing it. Chrome limbs, boss haircuts, and padded shoulders are the norm. CYB_R is the bridge between the monsters of fantasy gaming and the neon future we all feared we’d be living in by now. Each character class is modified from a tried and tested DD class, with innovative archetypes providing access to gambits: an alternative to spells. Gambits allow for heroic stunts, explosive maneuvers, and creative hacking talents. It’s all about style and gambits allow each character to really shine in their area of expertise.While the conversion isn’t particularly high-maintenance, there are only two backer tiers on CYB_R’s Kickstarter, one to receive a PDF copy of the corebook and the next level offering a hardcover copy. But for you tabletop fans out there, it’s a small price to pay. If you’re into it, fund the project here before the clock winds down.Judge Dredd: The Cursed Earth Available for Pre-OrderOsprey Publishing comes bearing news from the future: by February 21st, the world will be reduced to smoldering ashes, leaving behind nothing but seemingly-endless stretches of twisted, crime-ridden urban streets dominated by a fascist police state. Or rather, it will be if you dive back into the world of Judge Dredd in their upcoming card game, The Cursed Earth, which offers solo, co-op, and competitive gameplay as you track down criminals in Mega City One.Featuring brand-new art by veteran Judge Dredd illustrators, The Cursed Earth’s preorder package comes with exclusive promo cards and looks like a bloody good time. To get in on this limited-time offer, you can pre-order here.Android: Shadow of the Beanstalk is OnlineIf you’ve been keeping up on our coverage of Fantasy Flight Games’ sourcebook for the Genesys Roleplaying System, you likely know that Android: Shadow of the Beanstalk hit shelves on Thursday. For those of you who don’t know, here’s the description, saturated with irresistible cyberpunk tropes:In the not so-distant future, humanity has spread out across the solar system, unlocked the frontiers of cyberspace, and created millions of intelligent androids in its own image. At the heart of this progress stands a ladder leading to the riches of the stars—the massive space elevator called the Beanstalk. And at its base sprawls the biggest, meanest, and most exciting city on Earth: New Angeles. You can explore this world with Shadow of the Beanstalk, an Android sourcebook for the Genesys Roleplaying System! Take on the roles of cops, con artists, roughnecks, and escaped androids trapped between greedy corporations, corrupt officials, and vicious street gangs. Outwit your foes, uncover their conspiracies, flee their retribution, and maybe you’ll survive. Who knows? Maybe you’ll even get rich… Shadow of the Beanstalk is a 256-page sourcebook for use with the Genesys Roleplaying System.

Available at only $29.99, being able to play on both a screen and on the Switch handheld should be a fun change, and perhaps the most serious and thrilling videogame available on the Switch to date. Play as Daniel Lazarski (portrayed as none other than Rutger Hauer from Blade Runner!) and hack into the minds of victims and villains alike in order to unravel the mystery of your son’s disappearance in this dystopian world set in 2084 Poland.For the full scoop check it out here.Born Punk: Fully Funded in 24 HoursA recent Kickstarter campaign created by indie devs Insert Disk 22 has gained a lot of traction in the short time it’s been running, and it’s no wonder why. Born Punk hearkens back to the classic era of point-and-click games, featuring a ’90s-style cyberpunk atmosphere and a dash of humor and Shadowrun terminology thrown into the mix. The devs have stated that they’re making an effort to create logic-based puzzles as opposed to some of the more confusing and illogical ones of yesteryear. If that’s not enough to get you on board, consider the official description:The game follows Eevi Rinasdottir, a former corporate combat hacker. Eevi grew up in the bad parts of Bornholm – of which there are many in 2155 – and was forcefully recruited by a mega-corporation called Mitsotomo. One decade later, Eevi was forced to return to the place of her humble beginnings, to work as a barkeep for her foster father, and to dream of returning to the glittering corporate lifestyle she had grown used to. In the game, we meet Eevi as she is suffering an ungodly hangover, trying to prepare for a nightly ‘data drill’, a freelance hack meant to extract enough critical data from random targets to finance her comeback. What she doesn’t know is that an electronic entity has infected her cyberdeck (think brain-computer-implant). At least at first glance, this entity – likely a rogue AI – seems just as confused about the situation as Eevi is. As the story advances, the player will seek answers about the nature of the intruder, either come to terms with it or try to expel it from her body, struggle with suffering from what is essentially a digital multiple personality disorder (imagine having a self-aware talking program forced into your brain! … actually, that sounds kinda cool), and ultimately uncover a conspiracy that could change humanity’s future forever.Though the promotional video suggests that only the first scene is complete, the game is set for release in January 2020. If you want to throw as much money as you can at it, Born Punk’s Kickstarter campaign is still running here.MusicIndustrial music legends Front Line Assembly released a new album, Wake Up The ComaWake Up The Coma by Front Line AssemblyReleased on Metropolis Records, and the first single is a cover of the new wave classic “Rock Me Amadeus”, originally by Austria’s Falco.The video, featuring Jimmy Urine (of Mindless Self Indulgence) in a Max Headroom homage, took the industrial scene by surprise with a delightful retrowave aesthetics.Early fans rest assure, the rest of the album is the gritty electro-industrial that we know and love.Special EventsAlita: Battle Angel Escape RoomsFor you lucky cyberpunks living in New York, Austin, and LA, production company iam8bit has unveiled a new escape room experience of sorts that takes place in a number of detailed environments replicating sets that will appear in Alita: Battle Angel. Surprisingly, it doesn’t look to be a mere cash-grabby promo effort on the part of 20th Century Fox, featuring detailed, immersive sets and props.Located at 470 Driggs Ave in Brooklyn, 1901 East 51st St (Stage 3) in Austin, and 1025 E 16th St in Los Angeles, tickets for the experience are fairly inexpensive, going for $40 in NY and $25 at the latter locations for general admission tickets. If this piques your interests, book now–the simulation is live until March 3rd, and tickets are selling fast. You can pick up a set here.Night City Will Come to Life in San AntonioOn Memorial Day Weekend, Jackalope Studios will be hosting a very special event. Officially licensed by R. Talsorian Games and approved by Cyberpunk 2020 creator Mike Pondsmith, a live-action roleplaying event accurate to the game’s universe will be held in San Antonio, featuring insight into the legendary RPG’s upcoming edition, Cyberpunk Red. At this point, details as to how the event will play out are sparse, but you don’t care, you just know you’re tossing on your black trench coat and mirror shades because this sounds fucking incredible.The good news is that even if you’re not able to be physically present, you have the option to purchase a “remote ticket”, which will allow you to be a part of Cyberpunk: Night City through a dedicated internet space, implying that your role will be as a netrunner, manipulating events from afar. The bad news is ticket prices are a bit steep, starting currently at $128 for those willing to spend some of the LARP as an NPC or playing from home. Also, budding cyberpunk graphic designers have the opportunity to showcase their artwork by purchasing “ad spots”, either in flyer or video format (to be approved by the event’s staff). Whatever the case, if you’re a hardcore cyberpunk junkie, this is not something you’ll want to miss. You can get your tix here, reserve yours before the well runs dry.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

With simple rules and bountiful gameplay options, Zone Raiders looks like it’ll be a cozy fit for fans of Tsutomu Nihei, Axiom Verge, and The Matrix trilogy’s desert of the real.While the game itself (as of now) is open source, requiring either a set of custom miniatures or your own collection of sci-fi figurines to play, the rulebook is the current reward for donations of $30 or more. While the campaign has already met its goal, there are still 8 days left to snag yourself a little somethin’ somethin’. You can check out Zone Raiders’ Kickstarter here.CYB_RIf conventional tabletop gaming is more your style, however, we’ve got good news: Kelly Black, an independent tabletop game dev, is currently funding a genre adaptation of Dungeons  Dragons’ fifth edition. Toting a retrofuturistic backdrop and customizability that even allows you to toss in magic elements a la Shadowrun, CYB_R looks like an RPG out of our shiniest dreams and worst nightmares. But don’t take my word for it, here’s the official description:In the shadows of the corporate-owned cities, between the skyscraper headquarters and the luxury hotels, the desperate hone their skills and mod their tech. They seek that elusive edge. Mercenary or motivated, idealistic or just hungry; the street elite infiltrate, invade, and impersonate to make a buck off the giants of industry. This is the story of cybered-up outsiders slipping into the penthouse of dystopian accomplishment uninvited. It’s a retrofuturistic tale of defying the social order, the authorities, and the odds. CYB_R is a cyberpunk genre conversion for DD’s 5th edition, employing bleeding edge rules modifications to allow for cinematic gameplay and leveraging 5th edition’s template-style character building to allow for characters that just seem cool from the get go. Characters are post-future adventurers, pulling gigs for and against the most powerful entities on the globe and they’re looking rad doing it. Chrome limbs, boss haircuts, and padded shoulders are the norm. CYB_R is the bridge between the monsters of fantasy gaming and the neon future we all feared we’d be living in by now. Each character class is modified from a tried and tested DD class, with innovative archetypes providing access to gambits: an alternative to spells. Gambits allow for heroic stunts, explosive maneuvers, and creative hacking talents. It’s all about style and gambits allow each character to really shine in their area of expertise.While the conversion isn’t particularly high-maintenance, there are only two backer tiers on CYB_R’s Kickstarter, one to receive a PDF copy of the corebook and the next level offering a hardcover copy. But for you tabletop fans out there, it’s a small price to pay. If you’re into it, fund the project here before the clock winds down.Judge Dredd: The Cursed Earth Available for Pre-OrderOsprey Publishing comes bearing news from the future: by February 21st, the world will be reduced to smoldering ashes, leaving behind nothing but seemingly-endless stretches of twisted, crime-ridden urban streets dominated by a fascist police state.

For those of you who don’t know, here’s the description, saturated with irresistible cyberpunk tropes:In the not so-distant future, humanity has spread out across the solar system, unlocked the frontiers of cyberspace, and created millions of intelligent androids in its own image.

Available at only $29.99, being able to play on both a screen and on the Switch handheld should be a fun change, and perhaps the most serious and thrilling videogame available on the Switch to date. Play as Daniel Lazarski (portrayed as none other than Rutger Hauer from Blade Runner!) and hack into the minds of victims and villains alike in order to unravel the mystery of your son’s disappearance in this dystopian world set in 2084 Poland.For the full scoop check it out here.Born Punk: Fully Funded in 24 HoursA recent Kickstarter campaign created by indie devs Insert Disk 22 has gained a lot of traction in the short time it’s been running, and it’s no wonder why. Born Punk hearkens back to the classic era of point-and-click games, featuring a ’90s-style cyberpunk atmosphere and a dash of humor and Shadowrun terminology thrown into the mix. The devs have stated that they’re making an effort to create logic-based puzzles as opposed to some of the more confusing and illogical ones of yesteryear. If that’s not enough to get you on board, consider the official description:The game follows Eevi Rinasdottir, a former corporate combat hacker. Eevi grew up in the bad parts of Bornholm – of which there are many in 2155 – and was forcefully recruited by a mega-corporation called Mitsotomo. One decade later, Eevi was forced to return to the place of her humble beginnings, to work as a barkeep for her foster father, and to dream of returning to the glittering corporate lifestyle she had grown used to. In the game, we meet Eevi as she is suffering an ungodly hangover, trying to prepare for a nightly ‘data drill’, a freelance hack meant to extract enough critical data from random targets to finance her comeback. What she doesn’t know is that an electronic entity has infected her cyberdeck (think brain-computer-implant). At least at first glance, this entity – likely a rogue AI – seems just as confused about the situation as Eevi is. As the story advances, the player will seek answers about the nature of the intruder, either come to terms with it or try to expel it from her body, struggle with suffering from what is essentially a digital multiple personality disorder (imagine having a self-aware talking program forced into your brain! … actually, that sounds kinda cool), and ultimately uncover a conspiracy that could change humanity’s future forever.Though the promotional video suggests that only the first scene is complete, the game is set for release in January 2020. If you want to throw as much money as you can at it, Born Punk’s Kickstarter campaign is still running here.MusicIndustrial music legends Front Line Assembly released a new album, Wake Up The ComaWake Up The Coma by Front Line AssemblyReleased on Metropolis Records, and the first single is a cover of the new wave classic “Rock Me Amadeus”, originally by Austria’s Falco.The video, featuring Jimmy Urine (of Mindless Self Indulgence) in a Max Headroom homage, took the industrial scene by surprise with a delightful retrowave aesthetics.Early fans rest assure, the rest of the album is the gritty electro-industrial that we know and love.Special EventsAlita: Battle Angel Escape RoomsFor you lucky cyberpunks living in New York, Austin, and LA, production company iam8bit has unveiled a new escape room experience of sorts that takes place in a number of detailed environments replicating sets that will appear in Alita: Battle Angel. Surprisingly, it doesn’t look to be a mere cash-grabby promo effort on the part of 20th Century Fox, featuring detailed, immersive sets and props.Located at 470 Driggs Ave in Brooklyn, 1901 East 51st St (Stage 3) in Austin, and 1025 E 16th St in Los Angeles, tickets for the experience are fairly inexpensive, going for $40 in NY and $25 at the latter locations for general admission tickets. If this piques your interests, book now–the simulation is live until March 3rd, and tickets are selling fast. You can pick up a set here.Night City Will Come to Life in San AntonioOn Memorial Day Weekend, Jackalope Studios will be hosting a very special event. Officially licensed by R. Talsorian Games and approved by Cyberpunk 2020 creator Mike Pondsmith, a live-action roleplaying event accurate to the game’s universe will be held in San Antonio, featuring insight into the legendary RPG’s upcoming edition, Cyberpunk Red. At this point, details as to how the event will play out are sparse, but you don’t care, you just know you’re tossing on your black trench coat and mirror shades because this sounds fucking incredible.The good news is that even if you’re not able to be physically present, you have the option to purchase a “remote ticket”, which will allow you to be a part of Cyberpunk: Night City through a dedicated internet space, implying that your role will be as a netrunner, manipulating events from afar. The bad news is ticket prices are a bit steep, starting currently at $128 for those willing to spend some of the LARP as an NPC or playing from home. Also, budding cyberpunk graphic designers have the opportunity to showcase their artwork by purchasing “ad spots”, either in flyer or video format (to be approved by the event’s staff). Whatever the case, if you’re a hardcore cyberpunk junkie, this is not something you’ll want to miss. You can get your tix here, reserve yours before the well runs dry.Notice a cyberpunk story we missed this week?

Released on February 5th by Random House, this collection of short stories by spec-lit authors gives us visions of the future that tackle some of the most pressing issues of our time. While the variety ranges from hard sci-fi to fantasy, it looks like there’s enough dystopia in it to interest any cyberpunk. As per usual, the description: A glittering landscape of twenty-five speculative stories that challenge oppression and envision new futures for America—from N. K. Jemisin, Charles Yu, Jamie Ford, G. Willow Wilson, Charlie Jane Anders, Hugh Howey, and more. In these tumultuous times, in our deeply divided country, many people are angry, frightened, and hurting. Knowing that imagining a brighter tomorrow has always been an act of resistance, editors Victor LaValle and John Joseph Adams invited an extraordinarily talented group of writers to share stories that explore new forms of freedom, love, and justice. They asked for narratives that would challenge oppressive American myths, release us from the chokehold of our history, and give us new futures to believe in. They also asked that the stories be badass. The result is this spectacular collection of twenty-five tales that blend the dark and the light, the dystopian and the utopian. These tales are vivid with struggle and hardship—whether it’s the othered and the terrorized, or dragonriders and covert commandos—but these characters don’t flee, they fight. Thrilling, inspiring, and a sheer joy to read, A People’s Future of the United States is a gift for anyone who believes in our power to dream a just world. Featuring stories by Violet Allen • Charlie Jane Anders • Lesley Nneka Arimah • Ashok K. Banker • Tobias S. Buckell • Tananarive Due • Omar El Akkad • Jamie Ford • Maria Dahvana Headley • Hugh Howey • Lizz Huerta • Justina Ireland • N. K. Jemisin • Alice Sola Kim • Seanan McGuire • Sam J.
