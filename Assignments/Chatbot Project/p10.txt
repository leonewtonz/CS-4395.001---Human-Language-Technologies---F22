Cyberpunk music. Which tones and rhythms embody Cyberpunk? Which style defines the genre? As a Cyberpunk, which sound pulses relentlessly through your brain? Vaporwave perhaps? Maybe some Drum and Bass? Or are you chippin’ in? But when you strip away the sonics, and you look at the genre as a whole, its culture, attitude and style, which one is truly Cyberpunk? How about Acid Techno? Its genesis began in October 1990 when Chris Knowles, Julian Sandell and Aaron Northmore hosted their first event at Julian’s squat in North London. As Chris states in his interview with Louder Than War, it was “a techno rave (courtesy of us) on the first floor, and a hole cut in the floor with a fireman’s pole leading to a basement with punk bands playing, and a big fire in the garden serving as a chill out!” Friends from the North London/Stoke Newington squat scene, the three of them bonded over a love of techno and raving. Feeling out of place amongst the white-gloves and glow-stick culture of the burgeoning UK rave scene, they preferred to stick to their background of squat and punk culture, putting on parties in squats and underground venues, and doing their own illegal raves. “By doing illegal raves you were challenging the status quo, but also making parties the way we felt they should be made, with a dirtier, edgier feel. They were political by their very nature, and the ‘Fuck You’ attitude was always there.” Aaron recalls a lot of animosity at the start, “lot of the punk purists hated it at first”, but after putting on what they named a ‘Liberator party’, the Liberator DJs were born. They were playing different forms of Techno, such as Belgium and Detroit Techno, and Hardcore from the UK. But the music they really gravitated towards was the ravey acid stuff, like some of the Underground Resistance output. By 1993 they’d played everything from massive warehouse parties to Megadog, and the Castle Morton Free Festival, the largest ever illegal gathering in the UK, and decided they were going to put their first record out. Finding it difficult to buy the music they really liked, they set about it making it. Chris used to play drums for anarcho-punk band Hagar the Womb, and brought the DIY ethic of punk to their productions. They created the Stay Up Forever label in 1994 and released their first EP with fellow Hagar The Womb member Paul Harding. It would take several releases, and the meeting of additional like-minded ex-punks before Stay Up Forever nailed the blueprint for the sound of Acid Techno. Joined by Henry Cullen (D.A.V.E. the Drummer) and later Guy McAffer (The Geezer) from another anarcho-punk band, Back to the Planet, it was Cullen in particular that helped the Liberators hone the beefier sound that would become Acid Techno. The Liberators and Back to the Planet shared stages on a number of occasions, and in ’95 Cullen acted as engineer on a side-release from Chris Liberator in 1995 on Bag Records, Spectrum. By this point, Stay Up Forever was up to release number 10, and after their session on Spectrum, Cullen agreed to engineer a track for SUF11. That resulted in them co-producing the A side, Nothing Can Save Us, London! DDR took up the AA side, who Chris attributes as the one who pioneered the technique of writing harmonic 303 lines at Cullen’s studio. After meeting Lawrie Immersion and The Geezer, the acid heads had grown to include the Liberators, DDR, Gizelle, Immersion, The Geezer and Cullen (D.A.V.E. The Drummer). The collective of Acid Techno was born, encompassing Stay Up Forever, Smitten Records, Routemaster Records and Cluster Records. All setup, ran and produced by those involved in the free party squat scene, which was now firmly home to the sound of Acid Techno. And the collective kept on growing… “D.A.V.E. The Drummer’s seminal ‘HYDRAULIX’ techno label, Geezer’s train-track rolling beast R.A.W., Julian Liberator’s influential ‘4 x 4’ wonked-up hard techfunk ,Chris Liberator’s challenging analogue experiment ‘MAXIMUM MINIMUM’, and Ant’s chundering and groovy ‘POWERTOOLS’”. By 1997, the Acid Techno sound was well and truly formed, and permanently fused into history with the release of the now classic mix CD, It’s Not Intelligent…And It’s Not From Detroit…But It’s F**king ‘avin It! As the inlay states, “one sound above all has dominated the scene in 95-96 this being acid techno trance – spearheaded by labels like Stay Up Forever and Choci’s Chewns, and more recently Routemaster, Smitten and Bag. The DJ’s and activists involved in the scene were now making the music for it, a true and unique London acid sound, and the perfect soundtrack for the parties – exciting, hard and acidic! This collection of tracks represents the best of the music from 95-96 . It’s a no-holds barred feast of blistering 303’s and driving basslines, reflecting the energy and dynamism of London’s real alternative current, the parties and clubs of London’s dispossessed.It’s not Intelligent,It’s not from Detroit,But it’s fucking ‘avin it!!!”Image from Molly MacindoeLow LifeWhen you look at the definition of Low Life on Wikipedia, it’s less than complementary, citing examples of criminals, drug dealers, freeloaders, hobos and gangsters. But there are two neon lights of truth in the article, Low Life’s being both the anti-heroes of Cyberpunk, and those considered morally unacceptable by their own community. And that’s where Acid Techno culture again fits into the Cyberpunk ethos.“…when our thing became acid techno, it really got sniffed at by these techno people.”“it was really frowned on by the mainstream techno community, the people that kind of pulled strings didn’t like us.”“this is not proper Techno.”And so, after working together trying to find the sound that became Acid Techno, their scene was sniffed at by the Techno purists. But in true anti-hero style, they got their own back on the scene that rejected their sound, refused to book them and called their music “generic fucking acid techno, really shit.”From an interview with Lawrie Dunster, he called this out as one of the reasons why his Pounding Grooves label started anonymously. “People write shit in the press if your name is out there. There was period of time when I seemed to be in Mixmag, etc; every month, often with bullshit written… So I decided that ‘fame’ was not for me. I’ve never been a big fan of excessive adulation, I only want to make people dance, not for my ‘name’ to be big. So anonymousness was for me…”As one reviewer over at Discogs states about Pounding Grooves, “Filthiest, darkest and purest techno I have ever heard. Legendary.” And the Techno purists lapped it up. So much so in fact that the anonymous nature of the label and its releases drew interest as to who was really behind it all.There was speculation that Techno heavyweights like Cari Lekebush, Adam Beyer or Chris Liebing were behind Pounding Grooves.“Instead of course, it was the Squat party, Acid Techno bad boy of the time, Lawrie Immersion, either working on his own, or in cahoots with underground heroes such as D.A.V.E the Drummer or Geezer, so when the secret was revealed it caused quite a stir.”London. Acid. City. Our time is now.A key member of the scene from the start, Lawrie was infamous for his Immersion Sound System. A mainstay of the free party scene, and also a regular at Reclaim the Streets, ‘a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation’. In 1997 an eye-witness was front and centre at the Never Mind The Ballots social justice demonstration.“Lawrie Immersion drove through a number of police roadblocks to get into Trafalgar square that day and when he tried to leave (we had to push his van as it would not start) the police took him off and accused him of attempted murder LOL, a number of solicitors turned up at the police station and he was released I think without charge.”Together as Lochi, Lawrence Dunster and Chris Liberator released London Acid City on Lawrie’s newly formed Routemaster Records label. It soon became the anthem of Reclaim the Streets and was the first track blasted out by Lawrie’s system at the Trafalgar Square protest.Battling with the authorities was a permanent part of the Acid Techno scene, living up to its anarchic roots from squat parties, illegal warehouse raves and social movements. Sometimes the Police would leave them alone, other times they would come in hard and confiscate equipment. And that political stance was replayed through their releases, such as the 1998 release of Hackney Council Bunch of Cunts on TeC in 1998 and then a different track named Hackney Council : Bunch Of__ on Routemaster in 1999. Released after Hackney council seized Lawrie’s equipment.“Punks and anarchists built a vibrant counterculture to resist the unemployment and despair of Thatcher’s Britain during the 1980s.” And Hackney, in London, was one of the permanent locations for squat parties, including this huge one at Number 1 Brick Lane. With an amazing account of the night over at NR32 definitely worth a read.Hackney would be immortalised in a number of Acid Techno tracks, such as Tardis to Hackney, Hackney Soap Box, and the classic One Night in Hackney, itself a parody of The Horrorist’s One Night in New York City.Although compared to The Horrorist’s protagonist taking just one pill, the Stay Up Forever crew hits more of an excess…“And as I found my way to the dancefloor someone stopped me and said.Take this pill.So I took it and said – What was that.And they said EXSTACY.And then they offered me a line, and I said.What was that (snort) And they said KETAMINE.So I took it, and then I took some cocaine, and then some speed, and then some acid and then I drank 15 cans of stella.15 CANS OF STELLA.”Escaping Reality Through DrugsAs Shadowlink explored previously on ND, “In a fully cyberpunk world, the hazards, inconveniences, and consequently, the hesitations of drug use, whether legal or illegal, no longer exist—only the effects. Consume at your own risk.”And consumption goes hand in hand with Acid Techno. So much so that the use of ketamine on the free party scene was the subject of an academic paper back in 2008.And the releases themselves made constant reference to drug use. From One Night in Hackney above to Gizelle’s release as Rebel Yelle with Purple Heart, track names often pulled from the drug scene of Acid Techno. Two Lines of K…, The ‘E’ Spot, T.H.C., Mushrooms on Daleks, White Widow, B.4.U. (Come Down), Cocaine, the list goes on and on. It was the track names, and the lyrics, such as Inner City Junkies, on ROUTE 17…“got my spoon cookin’ brown, bangin’ skunk, smokin’ rock, tokin’ ket, sniffin’ coke, choppin’ base, poppin’ E! Tequila slammin’, blunt rollin’, innner city junkies!”Just look at Stay Up Forever, the record label logo is adorned with a pill and the letter e is highlighted.The Routemaster Records logo is the bus that was Lawrie Immersions home and studio, snorting a line of ketamine off a record as it plays on the 1210s.It doesn’t seem that it was glorifying drug use, more that it was such an intrinsic part of the anarchic scene, that like it’s anti-establishment stance, it ran through everything connected with Acid Techno, squat and free party culture. Possibly a nod to constantly trying to live outside the system. They ran the labels, they made the music, they could do whatever they want. It did sometimes cause problems though. Notably the cover for It’s Not Intelligent…It wasn’t the wrap of speed that was the problem. It was the, now masked, logo from the packet of skins that drew the ire of Rizla. Why? Because it was too close to the word Fucking for their liking. The cover was reprinted, although apparently Rizla still weren’t happy.High TechAcid Techno. It’s made with machines. Technology constantly pushing the frontiers of what’s possible with music. That’s the high tech. Job done. But Acid Techno manages to take it one step further.“The Street Finds Its Own Use For Things” – The classic quote from Gibson in Neuromancer, but what does it actually mean in practice?I’ve mentioned the word acid 27 times in this article so far, but haven’t explained what it is. If you’ve listened to some of the links, you may have noticed a distinct squelching, throbbing and bubbling sound running through many of the tracks. That’s the 303. That’s the acid.The Roland Transistor Bass 303 was a failed product. Based in Osaka, Japan, Roland was less that ten years old when it released the Roland TB-303 Bass Line in 1982. It was designed by engineer Tadao Kikumoto with one purpose in mind, to provide a synthetic and distinctive sound akin to an electric bass guitar. Roland’s initial aim was to take on Fender, the number one manufacturer of bass guitars at the time. It was a spectacular failure. In the US, it only shipped with manuals in Japanese, making the machine even trickier to program and sequence. It sounded nothing like a bass guitar, cost $395 and ultimately that meant its quirky nature and unrealistic sound failed to find an audience. After only 18 months of production it was cancelled, and the remaining units were sold off cheaply by Roland. It did find some form of commercial success, with a few tracks featuring its distinctive sound, such as Orange Juice’s 1983 release, Rip It Up. After its demise, the only places experiencing its bubbling acid were bargain bins and second-hand music stores.By 1985 the street was about to find its own use for the failed silver box. In Chicago, Phuture, founded by DJ Pierre, Earl ‘Spanky’ Smith and Herbert ‘Herb J’ Jackson would discover a sound that has defined electronic music ever since.“Spanky bought it used because you couldn’t get it new anymore, and he had it hooked up, running with the drum machine, but it wasn’t [working]. If you get one of those 303s it’s not going to have any baseline sounds in it, so you got to squeak and squack it till it makes some noise. He said he didn’t know what was wrong with it, how to program it right, so he said, “Could you figure it out?” So when I came over by it, I started twisting the knobs, seeing what they do, because that’s what I do: twist knobs. So I was doing that and we fell in love with the sounds it was making. We fell in love with how I was twisting the knobs with the beat. And then I started twisting them a certain way, and putting emotion and feeling behind it, and Spanky was like, “Yo Pierre, keep doing that, I like that.” I was like, “Yeah, this is something!” We were like, “Yo, that’s style.” We said forget trying to make a baseline, let’s program it like this and just twist the knobs. And so that’s what we did, you know.”Acid house was born.Their debut, Acid Tracks, destroyed dance floors with its pounding rhythms, rolling percussion, and of course, the raging acid line. According to DJ Pierre they gave it to Chicago DJ Ron Hardy. “he dropped it four times. The first two times, people were like “What the heck is this?” The third time people were like, “Okay, this sounds alright, I guess.” Then the fourth time, people went crazy. So he literally broke the record. He could have played it twice and been like, forget it, these people don’t get it. But he got it, and he had the vision that it was something. So really, he’s very important. Almost as important as we are in the creation of acid and acid house, because he broke it and he made it a sound that the whole city of Chicago was singing.”By 1987 Acid house was invading the United Kingdom and was one of the catalysts that fuelled the Second Summer of Love. The same social phenomena that brought the Liberators and the rest of the squat scene crews together. And when the Liberators were searching for that sound, it was the sound of the 303 more than anything that they latched onto.Chirs Liberator: “We started to get obsessive about the records we were buying, and by 93/94 there was a kind of European acid sound made by a few people, it got faster. It was a bit more trance. We didn’t like the keyboards, we didn’t like the trancey bits, we liked the acid and the fastness of the beat. We liked the Detroit acid, the heavy stuff but we didn’t like the softer, more melodic stuff.”Have a go yourself. Twist some knobs. See if you can come up with some raging acid lines: https://808303.studio/Then the street made it even squelchierSynth mods. The act of diving into the internals of a synthesiser and modifying it.The Quicksilver 303 mod replaces the original’s CPU. “With a completely rewritten operating system, all of the creative obstacles to programming amazing sequences have been removed. The experience still remains uniquely ‘303’.”The Borg mod, now discontinued, gave the 303 some extra squelch.And probably the most famous is the Devil Fish mod, for when the insane acid of the original 303 isn’t enough, you can push it even further with this mod. As witnessed in the Acid Techno track Around The Bend by Devil Fish Fury.And where else can you find releases by Devil Fish Fury, pushing the 303 to its limits? Why 909london.com of course, the site jointly setup by the Stay Up Forever crew to showcase all the latest Acid Techno.Because Acid Techno is as strong as ever.As Chris Liberator says here in this interview, “you can’t kill the spirit.”Time to turn on, tune in, drop out, cook brown, bang skunk, smoke rock, toke ket, sniff coke, chop base, pop E, slam tequila, get blunt rolling and channel your innner city junky._________________________________________________________Do you wear clothes?

From a purely technical point of view the sound producing part was more or less a cheap knockoff of the 70s moog design. They even used especially cheap parts, so tolerances were very bad and no two TB303 sound the same, ironically making this thing more unique and beloved by the few people actually using it.

But there are two neon lights of truth in the article, Low Life’s being both the anti-heroes of Cyberpunk, and those considered morally unacceptable by their own community. And that’s where Acid Techno culture again fits into the Cyberpunk ethos. “…when our thing became acid techno, it really got sniffed at by these techno people.” “it was really frowned on by the mainstream techno community, the people that kind of pulled strings didn’t like us.” “this is not proper Techno.” And so, after working together trying to find the sound that became Acid Techno, their scene was sniffed at by the Techno purists. But in true anti-hero style, they got their own back on the scene that rejected their sound, refused to book them and called their music “generic fucking acid techno, really shit.” From an interview with Lawrie Dunster, he called this out as one of the reasons why his Pounding Grooves label started anonymously. “People write shit in the press if your name is out there. There was period of time when I seemed to be in Mixmag, etc; every month, often with bullshit written… So I decided that ‘fame’ was not for me. I’ve never been a big fan of excessive adulation, I only want to make people dance, not for my ‘name’ to be big. So anonymousness was for me…” As one reviewer over at Discogs states about Pounding Grooves, “Filthiest, darkest and purest techno I have ever heard. Legendary.” And the Techno purists lapped it up. So much so in fact that the anonymous nature of the label and its releases drew interest as to who was really behind it all. There was speculation that Techno heavyweights like Cari Lekebush, Adam Beyer or Chris Liebing were behind Pounding Grooves. “Instead of course, it was the Squat party, Acid Techno bad boy of the time, Lawrie Immersion, either working on his own, or in cahoots with underground heroes such as D.A.V.E the Drummer or Geezer, so when the secret was revealed it caused quite a stir.” A key member of the scene from the start, Lawrie was infamous for his Immersion Sound System. A mainstay of the free party scene, and also a regular at Reclaim the Streets, ‘a resistance movement opposed to the dominance of corporate forces in globalisation’. In 1997 an eye-witness was front and centre at the Never Mind The Ballots social justice demonstration. “Lawrie Immersion drove through a number of police roadblocks to get into Trafalgar square that day and when he tried to leave (we had to push his van as it would not start) the police took him off and accused him of attempted murder LOL, a number of solicitors turned up at the police station and he was released I think without charge.” Together as Lochi, Lawrence Dunster and Chris Liberator released London Acid City on Lawrie’s newly formed Routemaster Records label. It soon became the anthem of Reclaim the Streets and was the first track blasted out by Lawrie’s system at the Trafalgar Square protest. Battling with the authorities was a permanent part of the Acid Techno scene, living up to its anarchic roots from squat parties, illegal warehouse raves and social movements. Sometimes the Police would leave them alone, other times they would come in hard and confiscate equipment. And that political stance was replayed through their releases, such as the 1998 release of Hackney Council Bunch of Cunts on TeC in 1998 and then a different track named Hackney Council : Bunch Of__ on Routemaster in 1999. Released after Hackney council seized Lawrie’s equipment. “Punks and anarchists built a vibrant counterculture to resist the unemployment and despair of Thatcher’s Britain during the 1980s.” And Hackney, in London, was one of the permanent locations for squat parties, including this huge one at Number 1 Brick Lane. With an amazing account of the night over at NR32 definitely worth a read. Hackney would be immortalised in a number of Acid Techno tracks, such as Tardis to Hackney, Hackney Soap Box, and the classic One Night in Hackney, itself a parody of The Horrorist’s One Night in New York City. Although compared to The Horrorist’s protagonist taking just one pill, the Stay Up Forever crew hits more of an excess… “And as I found my way to the dancefloor someone stopped me and said.Take this pill.So I took it and said – What was that.And they said EXSTACY.And then they offered me a line, and I said.What was that (snort) And they said KETAMINE.So I took it, and then I took some cocaine, and then some speed, and then some acid and then I drank 15 cans of stella.15 CANS OF STELLA.”Escaping Reality Through DrugsAs Shadowlink explored previously on ND, “In a fully cyberpunk world, the hazards, inconveniences, and consequently, the hesitations of drug use, whether legal or illegal, no longer exist—only the effects. Consume at your own risk.”And consumption goes hand in hand with Acid Techno. So much so that the use of ketamine on the free party scene was the subject of an academic paper back in 2008.And the releases themselves made constant reference to drug use. From One Night in Hackney above to Gizelle’s release as Rebel Yelle with Purple Heart, track names often pulled from the drug scene of Acid Techno. Two Lines of K…, The ‘E’ Spot, T.H.C., Mushrooms on Daleks, White Widow, B.4.U. (Come Down), Cocaine, the list goes on and on. It was the track names, and the lyrics, such as Inner City Junkies, on ROUTE 17…“got my spoon cookin’ brown, bangin’ skunk, smokin’ rock, tokin’ ket, sniffin’ coke, choppin’ base, poppin’ E! Tequila slammin’, blunt rollin’, innner city junkies!”Just look at Stay Up Forever, the record label logo is adorned with a pill and the letter e is highlighted.The Routemaster Records logo is the bus that was Lawrie Immersions home and studio, snorting a line of ketamine off a record as it plays on the 1210s.It doesn’t seem that it was glorifying drug use, more that it was such an intrinsic part of the anarchic scene, that like it’s anti-establishment stance, it ran through everything connected with Acid Techno, squat and free party culture. Possibly a nod to constantly trying to live outside the system. They ran the labels, they made the music, they could do whatever they want. It did sometimes cause problems though. Notably the cover for It’s Not Intelligent…It wasn’t the wrap of speed that was the problem. It was the, now masked, logo from the packet of skins that drew the ire of Rizla. Why? Because it was too close to the word Fucking for their liking. The cover was reprinted, although apparently Rizla still weren’t happy.High TechAcid Techno. It’s made with machines. Technology constantly pushing the frontiers of what’s possible with music. That’s the high tech. Job done. But Acid Techno manages to take it one step further.“The Street Finds Its Own Use For Things” – The classic quote from Gibson in Neuromancer, but what does it actually mean in practice?I’ve mentioned the word acid 27 times in this article so far, but haven’t explained what it is. If you’ve listened to some of the links, you may have noticed a distinct squelching, throbbing and bubbling sound running through many of the tracks. That’s the 303. That’s the acid.The Roland Transistor Bass 303 was a failed product. Based in Osaka, Japan, Roland was less that ten years old when it released the Roland TB-303 Bass Line in 1982. It was designed by engineer Tadao Kikumoto with one purpose in mind, to provide a synthetic and distinctive sound akin to an electric bass guitar. Roland’s initial aim was to take on Fender, the number one manufacturer of bass guitars at the time. It was a spectacular failure. In the US, it only shipped with manuals in Japanese, making the machine even trickier to program and sequence. It sounded nothing like a bass guitar, cost $395 and ultimately that meant its quirky nature and unrealistic sound failed to find an audience. After only 18 months of production it was cancelled, and the remaining units were sold off cheaply by Roland. It did find some form of commercial success, with a few tracks featuring its distinctive sound, such as Orange Juice’s 1983 release, Rip It Up. After its demise, the only places experiencing its bubbling acid were bargain bins and second-hand music stores.By 1985 the street was about to find its own use for the failed silver box. In Chicago, Phuture, founded by DJ Pierre, Earl ‘Spanky’ Smith and Herbert ‘Herb J’ Jackson would discover a sound that has defined electronic music ever since.“Spanky bought it used because you couldn’t get it new anymore, and he had it hooked up, running with the drum machine, but it wasn’t [working]. If you get one of those 303s it’s not going to have any baseline sounds in it, so you got to squeak and squack it till it makes some noise. He said he didn’t know what was wrong with it, how to program it right, so he said, “Could you figure it out?” So when I came over by it, I started twisting the knobs, seeing what they do, because that’s what I do: twist knobs. So I was doing that and we fell in love with the sounds it was making. We fell in love with how I was twisting the knobs with the beat. And then I started twisting them a certain way, and putting emotion and feeling behind it, and Spanky was like, “Yo Pierre, keep doing that, I like that.” I was like, “Yeah, this is something!” We were like, “Yo, that’s style.” We said forget trying to make a baseline, let’s program it like this and just twist the knobs. And so that’s what we did, you know.”Acid house was born.Their debut, Acid Tracks, destroyed dance floors with its pounding rhythms, rolling percussion, and of course, the raging acid line. According to DJ Pierre they gave it to Chicago DJ Ron Hardy. “he dropped it four times. The first two times, people were like “What the heck is this?” The third time people were like, “Okay, this sounds alright, I guess.” Then the fourth time, people went crazy. So he literally broke the record. He could have played it twice and been like, forget it, these people don’t get it. But he got it, and he had the vision that it was something. So really, he’s very important. Almost as important as we are in the creation of acid and acid house, because he broke it and he made it a sound that the whole city of Chicago was singing.”By 1987 Acid house was invading the United Kingdom and was one of the catalysts that fuelled the Second Summer of Love. The same social phenomena that brought the Liberators and the rest of the squat scene crews together. And when the Liberators were searching for that sound, it was the sound of the 303 more than anything that they latched onto.Chirs Liberator: “We started to get obsessive about the records we were buying, and by 93/94 there was a kind of European acid sound made by a few people, it got faster. It was a bit more trance. We didn’t like the keyboards, we didn’t like the trancey bits, we liked the acid and the fastness of the beat. We liked the Detroit acid, the heavy stuff but we didn’t like the softer, more melodic stuff.”Have a go yourself. Twist some knobs. See if you can come up with some raging acid lines: https://808303.studio/Then the street made it even squelchierSynth mods. The act of diving into the internals of a synthesiser and modifying it.The Quicksilver 303 mod replaces the original’s CPU. “With a completely rewritten operating system, all of the creative obstacles to programming amazing sequences have been removed. The experience still remains uniquely ‘303’.”The Borg mod, now discontinued, gave the 303 some extra squelch.And probably the most famous is the Devil Fish mod, for when the insane acid of the original 303 isn’t enough, you can push it even further with this mod. As witnessed in the Acid Techno track Around The Bend by Devil Fish Fury.And where else can you find releases by Devil Fish Fury, pushing the 303 to its limits? Why 909london.com of course, the site jointly setup by the Stay Up Forever crew to showcase all the latest Acid Techno.Because Acid Techno is as strong as ever.As Chris Liberator says here in this interview, “you can’t kill the spirit.”Time to turn on, tune in, drop out, cook brown, bang skunk, smoke rock, toke ket, sniff coke, chop base, pop E, slam tequila, get blunt rolling and channel your innner city junky._________________________________________________________Do you wear clothes?

Synthpop isn’t something I often frequent, with most of the music I consume ranging from the calming to the schizophrenic. Vocals are often a foreign concept to me as well, with most of my playlist being filled with screams, gibbering, or the sound of electronics being tortured. But variety is the spice of life, my dear punks!  BEKIMACHINE delivered a solid indie album of well mixed, written, and sung tunes with nary a scream to be had. Starting with her latest full album, Saga is 5 tracks long with no song going over 5 minutes. The whole thing is a quick listen, but it does not have in length it delivers in quality. There is no long droning noise or harsh sounds. A song never went longer than it needed to with nothing that felt like filler. And nothing felt, for lack of a better word, cute? Pop is often seen as the softer side of music and taken less seriously, but this is far from soft. Soothing, sure, but deserving of praise. We kick off with the short track “The Sea of Changes” (my second favorite track), which is a nice melodic intro to the rest of the album having a build-up to echoing vocals and some fine layering. Next up is my most favorite track, “Oblivion”, which is the poppiest track of the bunch, with some oddly dark lyrics for such a catchy tune. “In the zone it might wisp away the dim lights Wander right into the oblivion Stone cold, stiff face Want it now? I’m on the case Fallen down into the oblivion” I find the music composition simple in this one, starting with a simple tune of a UFO looping through your brain to pick up immediately with the rhythmic vocals. I don’t know what form of mind-control she has laced through the beat, but I found this song stuck in my head as I ventured to the grocery store decked out in an anti-virus mask and gloves. I couldn’t have asked for a better song to follow me around for the end of the world. “Super Machine” and “Flux” are my least favorite tracks, and not because of the composition but the repetitive lyrics in both undermine her amazing voice, I feel. I know that, in pop music, repetitive lyrics are common, but I feel they hurt the obvious talent the artist displays in her other tracks.Some tracks often felt they were telling a story and that was absent for those two. Thankfully we end on a high note with the most cybork of tracks, “Ionheart”. Easily something that could be a backdrop to Battle Angel Alita, the track starts with a slow vocal/piano that builds up by soaking up some bleak vocals. From there the popsynth kicks off into the familiar strong vocals and beats that have gotten branded into my grey matter. “Cut your skin for the feeling Tear the flesh that’s concealing your ionheart It’s too late to fall apart” In April, BEKIMACHINE hit us with a single track EP that shows some serious progression in form. A soft ramp-up builds into a solid dance beat that goes waves to let the vocals pick it up again. If the strongest part of the previous album were the vocals, this single improves on the electronic bits greatly.  The only thing I hate is there is only one track, because I love seeing an artist progress like this. Bekimachine also does some occasional live content on her Youtube Channel, so be sure to check it out if you dig her two albums.   Michael Rothe   July 13, 2020, 10:24 am  A little off topic, but has anyone else listened to much vaporwave? The genre and cyberpunk really do go hand-in-hand, in my opinion. It’s less pop and more chopped and screwed 80s/90s songs. Maybe the consummate vaporwave artist is Macintosh Plus and their album Floral Shoppe. There’s some debate about just what the genre is trying to say, centered mainly around whether it embraces accelerationism (the idea that capitalism should be accelerated to generate radical social change) or uses irony as a method of critique of consumer culture. I think that exploring vaporwave as a style would be a perfect segue into a broader philosophy, and not just an exploration of a sound and aesthetic as it relates to cyberpunk. Though there are merits to both kinds of exploration.

Astral Tales’ new release, The Last Resplendent, marks the end of the Red Iris Saga. Or should I say the beginning? I have presented Astral Tales’ body of work here, but let’s recap the story so far. The band’s first album and the core of the narrative, Landing, was telling the story of a young woman, Red Iris, leaving her war-ridden planet in a spaceship, her journey through space, and her finding a new home. In Raytracers, a prequel to Landing and the most cyberpunk-themed album of the saga, we are brought to the corrupted world left by Red Iris, with the album hinting at some mystical power at play in the form of “rays of powers”, here being co-opted by corporate wrongdoers. Then, Seafari, a sequel to Landing, shows the new life of Iris in her newly discovered home.  The Last Resplendent is designed as a prequel to Raytracers, which makes it the earliest part of the narrative, and it goes further back in the mythology of the Rays. This origin story takes place on the planet Layar, where the Daughters of Light, also known as the Resplendent, protect the Rays of Light from the Sons of Darkness. Inevitably war ensues, and after mutual destruction only the union of the Last Resplendent and the Hunter (allegedly, the last Son of Darkness) can save the Rays and project them into space, only for them to end up on the “small blue planet”, home of Red Iris, bringing us back to the beginning of Raytracers.   Seafari, Astral Tales’ previous release, was more chill vaporwave than cool synthwave. The Last Resplendent, however, marks a complete u-turn, straight back to the classic synthwave of Landing and Raytracers. Of the nine tracks of The Last Resplendent, track 1 (Layar and the Rays of Light) and 9 (One Last Farewell) serve narrative purposes and frame the albums story nicely. Gears of Creation, depicting the manufacturing of the cybernetic Sons of Darkness, is an interesting mix of glitchy sound, upbeat pop, and epic guitars. Arrival and Temple of the Stars build up the atmosphere that climaxes with Eleven Armies, Through the Garden of Exile and The Hunter, the latter three being complex compositions that forms the core of the album.  But my favorite track on the album is Beyond the Gate of Cizin, one of the few tracks with vocals, and the only one sung by Ernesto Bernal (a.k.a. “Astral Tales”). Just like on Raytracers on the track We Will Remain (another favorite), Bernal’s voice, even treated with effects, has a contemplative quality that I find quite engaging.   I’m not particularly fond of synthwave, nor of pixel art, but this is why I love Astral Tales, and Through the Garden of Exile is a bizarre mix of vaporous glitches and smooth 80’s sax topped off with amazing art. Listening to this didn’t make sense until I watched the video and paid attention to the story it tells. Then, everything fell into place, and what I don’t like about retro aesthetics gives way to what I really like about Astral Tales: a flair for drama, backed by a great sense of pacing.  As I have noted before, Astral Tales stands out among the glutted synthwave genre due to its attention to narrative and its dedication to new sounds. I mean, on the Bandcamp platform, land of the “bedroom producers”, who goes on and records a children’s choir? Astral Tales, that’s who.   Landing came with a beautiful digital booklet that established the story. The Last Resplendent is accompanied by 9 pixel art videos (9!), created by Guillaume “Gyhyom” Breton, and each video opening with a fragmentary text that drives the story further ahead.  The aesthetics of the videos seems to be inspired by precolonial
South American cultures (and that may or may not be due to the fact
that Astral Tales are from Spain), with names like “Quetzal” or
“Cizin”, and the evocation of leopards and eagles in the
narrative bits. But the Sons of Darkness are definitively “augmented”
in some ways. So what is it? Raypunk, I guess. The science fantasy of
some Final Fantasy titles comes to mind.  With The Last Resplendent, Astral Tales returns to its synthwave roots and continues to push the envelope with a carefully crafted narrative and more quality visuals than should be expected from a pop record. This album may stray from pure cyberpunk themes, but the saga as a whole shows how cyberpunk can be integrated in a much wider narrative.  The paid version comes with two bonus tracks : Jungle [MGS Remix], previously unreleased; and Contactless, a single from 2018.  Astral Tales – The Last Resplendent : 7/10.

After a grueling night shift in a factory that seems to have more robotic employees than human, you wake coated in sweat. Has it always been this hot this time of year? Your memory seems to escape you—you have more important things to worry about than the weather. Like enough money to cover your ever-rising living costs. You still have to hear back from your dealer about that addy, but demand is up right now, so you might have to slug it for a couple weeks, and that’s gonna be hell. What’s more, your wi-fi is for shit and it seems like all your tech is falling prey to planned obsolescence. Wasn’t summer supposed to be carefree? Ten, fifteen years
ago, didn’t people do stupid shit like go on road trips or out to the nearest
body of water to just sit on its shores and enjoy the rec drug of their choice?
Everyone says this is what it’s like in the “real world” and you just gotta get
used to it. But these are the same people who slave away in cubicle farms,
taking pay cuts and making sacrifices just to get by. We’re all being roasted
alive in the city, but it’s like nobody’s been outside long enough to take
notice. Like frogs on a slow boil. At least music is more accessible now than it’s ever been. You slip in a pair of noise-cancelling wireless headphones and connect to a corporation-backed music streaming service, longing for it to take you somewhere else between the ads, somewhere you can forget that there’s no way out of this world we’ve made for ourselves. But you know it won’t, no matter how well the app knows your tastes in music. Still, you can’t help but notice a trend in music at large lately—the detachment, the disillusionment, and for some reason punk bands are singing about extreme body modding now. It doesn’t happen often, and sometimes comes from the strangest of places, but you wonder if the people writing these songs feel as trapped by society and anxious of what cybernetic horrors the future holds as you do. If you can’t find a way to escape, then maybe you can find solace instead. Let me add to your woes. I admit I’m relatively new to cyberpunk music as a genre, but I prefer to listen to the music that falls onto my radar through an augmented ear. Something about these songs I’ve come across over the past couple years screams cyberpunk to me, whether it’s the message or the vibe they’re sending out. You might not associate their sounds with tales from the near future, but that’s not what this is about—this is about the Cyberpunk Now. Take a listen, maybe you’ll find something you like. I was originally going to write a separate article on InnerPartySystem, a three-piece dance punk outfit from Pennsylvania, as their music contains heavy industrial elements and the topics they address are very in line with the cyberpunk worldview, despite being fully grounded in the present. They constantly reference dystopian imagery—their name is a clear reference to 1984, and their Download and Never Be Content EPs speak to the cynicism and technofetishism we’re all familiar with. Unfortunately, aside from their self-titled debut album, the band hasn’t released any music over the past decade, and the lyrics on InnerPartySystem stand on shaky ground when comparing tracks. Still, for their short run, they showed immense promise and make me wonder what could have been if they’d continued making music. “Don’t Stop”, for instance, is a high-voltage criticism of the third-order simulacra that is celebrity culture, vehemently tearing into the cult of fame’s vapid and destructive nature. “Everyone is the Same” speaks to classic dystopian themes of conformity, putting lead singer Patrick Nissley in the role of a Winston Smith-esque character with bite. And for some reason I have a fixation on lyrics that provide a cynical take on hedonistic culture, as heard in “Die Tonight Live Forever”. Perhaps the growing self-awareness among the party crowd speaks to something deeper in me—I know that drugs, sex, and other ephemeral pleasures are simply a means of escaping our harsh reality and don’t fix our problems, but we’re trapped by our vices, as though it’s by design. “We’re all here because we’ve lost control” Fortunately, “American Trash” takes the best elements of the
above tracks and rolls them into one. InnerPartySystem lashes out against
America’s propaganda machine with chaotic misanthropy over electronic riffs
that’ll make any industrial fan’s spine tingle. If there’s a more relevant time
for InnerPartySystem to start making music again, it’s now. Sling your insults, lowlives. You probably are most familiar with Grimes as the contentious romantic interest of billionaire/genuine asshole Elon Musk, but hey, it turns out she has a music career too! As you might have noticed by the cringeworthy music video above, Grimes has a penchant for classic cyberpunk like Akira, which is on full display in her most recent single, “We Appreciate Power”, a fusion of pop and industrial that depicts a cultlike affinity for society’s artificialization. However, the lyrics are a bit on the nose and “Kill V. Maim” has a more original construction, so I’m doing that one instead. You probably hate it. I kind of hate it too, but it’s so
fucking catchy. The premise behind the lyrics sounds like it was written by a
crazy person, inspired by Michael Corleone’s character transformation in The
Godfather: Part II. But also like, what if he was a vampire? So why am I including a god damn pop song in a cyberpunk music article? Well, from where I stand, “Kill V. Maim” represents a slight shift in the pop culture landscape—Grimes’ vocals shift from sickeningly sweet to harsh and growly on a dime, scored by electronic instrumentation with an industrial drumbeat. The edges that Grimes occasionally toy with in her writing is indicative of the other half of music intertwined with cyber culture, which we have labeled in the past as cyberpop. While Grimes’ J-pop influences come through with astounding clarity, cyberpop hasn’t quite gained a foothold in the western world just yet, and doesn’t seem to be a recognized genre among music critics. But consider this: while Grimes may be a lunatic, she certainly has more notoriety in pop culture than most of the musicians we cover. Should Grimes become an influence on other mainstream artists, it might mark society’s general disposition towards the cyberpunk dystopia we live in. Who knows, maybe that fateful day when your number comes up and the megacorps send a razorgirl after you, she might be listening to this song as she repos your cloned heart by cutting it out, smiling innocently. Another example of cyberpop, Korean musician Yukari’s “Am I Dreaming” is a simple, tranquil tune that feels like a reprieve from the crushing nature of urban society. It’s something to drown out the noise of traffic and helicopters on those long summer nights. Yukari brings dream pop into the 21st century, opting out of any analog instruments—even her voice has a too-perfect quality to it at moments, and I still can’t quite tell if it’s been autotuned. For all I know, this track could have been composed and performed by an artificial intelligence. It’s easy to get lost in the atmosphere Yukari creates, weaving imagery that feels stunningly peaceful in our world gone wrong, but her single repeated lyric almost sounds like a cry for help. “Tell me I’m dreaming” You’re dreaming, Yukari. The desert of the real awaits. I’ll admit this addition to the list is almost obligatory. “Strict Machine” has already appeared in two major cyberpunk franchises: in the second act of 2012’s Dredd we hear it played in a drug den; in “Crocodile”, an episode from the fourth season of Black Mirror, it’s played at a club. However, “Strict Machine” is in a league of its own among London-based trip hop duo Goldfrapp’s library of works. It seems to insinuate that our obsession with technology is like being in a sadomasochistic relationship with an android, allowing it to control our every move. The song’s fully synthesized instrumentals and Alison Goldfrapp’s airy vocals, as usual, seem to be following the trend among featured artists in this article series, which I think helps with its street cred. In the same vein as “Strict Machine”, “Radio” harshly criticizes the modern shape of the music industry, though you might not notice if you’re just listening to its energetic, poppy grooves. Sylvan Esso, hailing from Durham, North Carolina, expresses the frustration of living in an overconnected society that demands constant content generation. This is reinforced by many of the song’s elements; the synths sound like something out of an informational video about new technology from the 1980s, conveying sterility while adding a measure of grace through Amelia Meath’s rich vocals, which fall into a chorus that sounds something like a draining battery struggling to pump out more juice. All while reminding us that someone’s always keeping an eye on that music industry standard: three minutes and thirty seconds, the ideal time for a radio single. Sardonic and vicious, “Radio” may be the only way Sylvan Esso knows how to speak out against a society that’s working us to death. For an example of cyberpunk-themed prog rock from the last place you’d expect, “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” is the final chapter of the indefinable concept album Murder of the Universe, one of the five (FIVE) albums put out by the immensely talented, Australia-hailing King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard in 2017. If you haven’t given it a listen yet, be forewarned—it gets pretty damn intense. Narrated by Natural Reader’s UK, Charles text-to-speech app as Han-Tyumi, the story follows a cyborg born into a digital realm who finds no meaning in his existence and desires only two things: to vomit and to die. In order to achieve these goals, Han-Tyumi creates a machine that will allow him to make a spectacle of puking. Of course, things go downhill as soon as Han-Tyumi chooses to merge with the machine, who is disgusted with its own existence. Han-Tyumi begins spewing his guts out infinitely, which eventually consumes his universe. Dark and deeply unsettling, the narrative of “Han-Tyumi and the Murder of the Universe” is claustrophobia-inducing and draws similarities to cyberpunk horror flicks like Tetsuo: The Iron Man. This might be the one. The ultimate dystopian summer track. For some reason I find shoegaze to be immensely cyberpunk in nature when it chooses to be, and “Sun Was High” fits the mold almost perfectly. Originally composed and recorded by surf rock revival duo Best Coast, Small Black‘s cover warps the original meaning of the song without changing a single lyric. Its moody, distorted synths sound less like a love song and more like the pit in your stomach that you feel instantly upon waking from a long bender fueled by a cornucopia of substances. In a haze as you find yourself roaming the blistering steel corridors of the metropolis in which you reside, you feel like there’s something important you needed to remember, but you can’t quite put your finger on it. Instead, your mind drifts back to the person you’d set out to forget in the first place. It’s a very specific feeling, and one that I know too well. We’ll be back to our regularly scheduled dose of metareality next month. Until then, if you want to go more in-depth with musicians that are shaping the world of music into the one cyberpunk predicted, you can find all Soundtracks to a Dying World articles here. In the meantime, what are some dystopian singles that have popped up in your lives?

Perturbator is without a doubt the best known synthwave artist presently active. What is less known, however, is that Perturbator is James Kent, son of Nick Kent, journalist for the seminal British music magazine New Musical Express. Back in 1976, Nick Kent had a tense relationship with the emerging UK punk rock scene, culminating in his being beaten with a motorcycle chain by Sid Vicious, an event that allegedly won the latter his nickname and his role as a bassist in the Sex Pistols. Kent eventually came around, embraced punk rock, and even conducted a heartbreaking interview with a very self-conscious Vicious apparently oblivious of their previous relation. This is all circumstantial, but I can’t help but think that this factoid, this indirect contact with punk culture, has something to do with Perturbator being the meanest of synthwave acts. And this is the paradox of Perturbator: I’ve never seen this many metal t-shirts at an electro gig, and yet there was this girl sporting an 80ies aerobic jumpsuit straight out of Flashdance. The SAT in Montréal (Canada) looks like a warehouse, with concrete columns and an open ceiling full of pipes and wires, so it’s the perfect venue for alienated youth, and for bands like Soft Moon, Atari Teenage Riot or Nitzer Ebb, all of which having played there in the last couple of years. Behind the stage were columns of light bulbs and columns of moving searchlights that felt like police choppers were searching the crowd. On the ceiling, in the middle of the pit, was a strobe light that frequently flashed the audience, something usually seen in nightclubs and not at live shows, thus imposing a sort of “party” feel to the event. I was happy to notice the drum kit on the stage. As much as I love drum machines… there is nothing like live drums. I wish, however, that the balance would have been just a little more on the synth, as the pounding rhythms were muffling the leads. Perturbator plays a Prophet-6 sequencer synth as his main instrument, with a DSI Morpho X4 as a backup. From what I saw, Kent mostly uses his keyboard to trigger arpeggiators and enveloped PADs, and rarely play actual melodies. This is strictly factual and not a comment on his musicianship, I care very little for virtuosity and synthwave is mostly an atmospheric genre, therefore we should not expect otherwise. I must confess to have a negative bias against cheesy ballads like “Meet Jimmy” (from the Sexualizer EP), and this is something that keeps me from truly embracing synthwave. However, Perturbator live and in person takes no prisoners. Save from the heavy and slow “Birth of the New Model” in lieu of intro, the performance was loud and fast. All tracks played came from his latest releases (New Model, The Uncanny Valley, Dangerous Days), but with such great pieces like “Neo-Tokyo” and “Humans Are Such Easy Prey”, how could we complain? The great “Welcome Back / Perturbator’s Theme” were aptly played as an encore, with “The Cult of 2112” closing the night. Despite not talking to the crowd at all, Perturbator knows how to communicate with his audience. Frequently standing on the base of his synth stand, saluting the room with a victorious raised fist, or clasping his hands in a thankful gesture on numerous occasions. He has a great stage presence, somehow aggressive while still standing behind his machines, and often spinning his hair in a metal fashion. The previous visit of Perturbator in Montréal was part of the Metal festival Heavy MTL, which was odd since to the best of my knowledge no other electronic act has ever played the festival in his ten years of existence. Now that I’ve seen Perturbator live, it makes perfect sense. This is as close to heavy metal electronica can get. Your email address will not be published.

If you think about it, the histories of video game and cyberpunk culture are closely intertwined. Both began gestating in the late 1970s and began leaving their marks on pop culture in the ‘80s. The “punk” element in modern dystopian fiction typically manifests itself in the hacker archetype, who rebels against the system through an intensive knowledge of computers; similarly, many of the video game developers I’ve met aesthetically and/or ideologically have a bit of a rebellious streak in them. There have been cyberpunk video games and cyberpunk media about video games. And, if you look at video game culture today, you might find that there’s a lot of overlap between it and modern punk culture (although that may have to do with the all-encompassing reach of video games among millennials). I like to look at the gaming world as cyberpunk’s charismatic older brother—it tends to get a lot more attention, is really into sports, and has more opportunities to explore its potential. The video game scene might get itself into hot water every once in a while, but it’s still going strong. Meanwhile, video games’ loner kid sibling, cyberpunk, is sitting quietly in a corner, hacking the mainframes. Of course, video games over the years have become infinitely more sophisticated than they were in the early days—after all, triple A games oftentimes have budgets that are as large (sometimes even bigger) than your average summer or holiday blockbuster. Unfortunately, it seems that most billion-dollar game publishers these days are taking advantage of none of the near-infinite possibilities at their fingertips, instead choosing to produce the same games over and over again until society inevitably implodes—perhaps even longer, depending on how far EA decides to raise the bar in sadism and corporate greed. Alternatively, lower-budget indie games typically get around their budget constraints by providing simpler gameplay and aesthetics that oftentimes call back to pre-fifth-generation console games. But this is a music article, and the above is my roundabout way of saying that video game soundtracks are not inherently one thing—as with any medium, soundtracks for video games are designed to set a certain kind of tone, and since the very beginning, they’ve been inspired by film scores and musicians to create a more immersive experience. However, there is a quality to ‘80s and ‘90s video game music that seems to be fairly unique to the medium: that sort of mashup between simplistic electronic midis and jazzy or dancey beats that attempt to capture the magic of old-school 2D platformers and adventure games in the chiptune (or 8-bit) genre of music. In fact, composers of chiptune music, whether or not the music itself is attached to any developers’ projects, have their own cyberpunk-DIY element to them, as many composers actually tap into into the programmable sound generator chips in vintage consoles, arcade cabinets, and PCs in order to create their music. But this isn’t enough to get chiptune as a whole the official ND stamp of approval, especially if the soundtrack is set to a kid-friendly game that the developer came up with while on some pretty serious hallucinogens. In short: you can’t really make a cyberpunk video game soundtrack unless you set out with that intention. Unless you’re Richard Vreeland, aka Disasterpeace. Vreeland’s introduction to music was early in life, as he was raised in a family of singers and instrumentalists. As a child, he learned to play the drums, picked up the guitar in high school, and by the age of 17 began to compose music under the stage name Disasterpeace. His first effort, History of the Vreeland, was inspired by the music of Rage Against the Machine (these guys just keep popping up lately) and Tool, and has a very heavy, rock-inspired sound. By 2006, when Vreeland was in college, he was commissioned by a mobile game developer after his demos were discovered online, and his career since has been thriving immensely. Of course, as a commissioned composer, Disasterpeace has toyed with a wide range of music styles over the years, from your typical video-gamey soundtrack to blues rock to symphonic to acoustic. But like many great composers, Disasterpeace has certain trademarks as an artist that, when included, are as instantly recognizable as John Williams’ use of strings and woodwinds in his film scores. While Vreeland himself is not a performer and makes his music without hacking into a SNES, there is something about select albums he’s put out that are distinctly, uniquely Disasterpeace. That something sounds cyberpunk as fuck. The more substantial aspect of Vreeland’s music career began in slightly more conventional veins, with him composing concept albums that sound like fusions of 8-bit and prog rock  for video games that will likely never be made. While Disasterpeace structures music with mathematical precision, composing in atypical rhythms and layering complex electronic melodies with what sometimes feels like an overwhelming swarm of moving parts, evidence of his music’s evolution into a never-before-heard sound can be found on 2011’s Rise of the Obsidian Interstellar and Deorbit, a standalone concept album that wordlessly chronicles a space opera and a prequel B-side album, respectively. While both are still bear heavy chiptune elements, accompanied by basic blips and boops you might hear off an NES game, it’s in these albums that you can hear Vreeland’s music seemingly take a page from noise rock and shoegaze, incorporating heavily distorted, ambient tracks. This might also be a little obvious, but as industrial music and home consoles began to gain popularity around the same time in the ‘80s, it’s undeniable that some video game soundtracks have been inspired by industrial’s experimental nature. Ironically, while very light inclusion of these elements can be heard on the aforementioned albums (perhaps by accident on the composer’s part), these are ironically nowhere to be found on 2012’s KRUNCH soundtrack, which may be the closest to cyberpunk Vreeland has ever come. KRUNCH, a simple 16-bit obstacle-racing game, takes place in a massive, hostile factory that fully robotic beings are attempting to escape from. However, Vreeland hadn’t quite settled into his sound until 2012’s FEZ soundtrack, an album that features heavily ambient tracks distorted heavily by digital static. Discarding traditional 8-bit sounds for vaporwave and dream poppy synths, Vreeland successfully lives up to the Disasterpeace name by presenting us with tracks that simultaneously feel calming and foreboding, oftentimes pairing melodies that capture the spirit of curiosity and exploration to elements that seem to suggest something more sinister if one chooses to look past the surface. This, of course, is fitting with theme of Polytron’s FEZ, a game in which you play as Gomez, a character that can only perceive the second dimension until he puts on the titular headgear, which aids him in a quest across a ruined, three-dimensional world. And while this retelling of Plato’s Allegory of the Cave in a digital context may be something that any jaded hacker or information courier can find appealing, the game itself is decidedly not cyberpunk. Despite this, many tracks off the album, without context, might sound perfectly appropriate in a cyberpunk atmosphere. Here, try this one on for size: Do you hear it yet? Not quite? Well if you’re having a little trouble, let’s pull a track off of Disasterpeace’s first foray into cinema, the It Follows soundtrack. He sounds like Vangelis. I hate to make direct comparisons between musicians, I really do. It’s a bad habit to get into and it undercuts the significance of a musician’s work. But here’s the thing: Vreeland has explicitly stated on his blog that Vangelis’ iconic Blade Runner soundtrack and music of similar varieties have not played a role in his creative process, having only seen Blade Runner once many years prior to the post. I’ll come back to this thought in a minute, but right now it’s more important that you know a little bit more about Disasterpeace’s music history. Fitting perfectly with the Disasterpeace style, Vreeland’s score to David Robert Mitchell’s 2015 indie cult horror film It Follows draws inspiration from John Carpenter’s own compositions, resulting in a deeply discordant, intense soundtrack that is legitimately freaking me out as I’m listening to it while I write this. The film itself, while toting a fixation on ‘90s-era style in the suburbs of Detroit, bears no cyberpunk trappings, though the concept itself—a sexually-transmitted monster that hunts down and murders whoever bears its curse—feels like a combination between The Terminator and The Thing gone art house, and the soundtrack’s jarring, heart-pounding nature not only supplements the psychological elements, but carries them across the finish line. Disasterpeace also composed the soundtrack for 2016’s Hyper Light Drifter, another massively successful 16-bit indie game from Heart Machine. A near-completely nonhuman space opera that takes place on a planet long after its native civilization was decimated by war, HLD follows a laser-sword-bearing alien who seeks to find the cure to their terminal illness among the ruins’ forgotten technologies. While the idea of the knowledge of technology lost to time which appears as magic in futuristic settings is something that cyberpunk toys around with from time to time, you can’t exactly have cyberpunk without human characters. And yet, despite the space opera leanings, if you hadn’t been given the context for many tracks on this album, wouldn’t they sound like something you might hear in a world akin to that of Ghost in the Shell or Deus Ex? As I’ve mentioned before, I’m a firm believer in the universal unconscious, as I’m sure many of you are. For those of you who aren’t quite as familiar, the universal unconscious (or zeitgeist, the “spirit of the time”) is the concept that all humans, whether on a macro or micro scale, have sets of ideas that bind us together as communities, as cultures, and as a species. While the core of the universal unconscious, that mercurial pool of the things that make us human, remains (mostly) unchanged over time, the attitudes many of us share are constantly shifting. Ideas constantly evolve. Human thought on a mass scale is nearly incomprehensible, but on the individual level it’s responsible not only for everything we do, but how we express ourselves through our actions. Those who engage in creative careers tend to immerse themselves in their work, shifting their entire mindsets for the sake of their art. And none of us are ever completely certain where our ideas come from, but they have to come from somewhere—whether from some stimulus that we either registered subconsciously or an idea that we cobbled together from our own thoughts. So my point is this: thirty years before Disasterpeace composed the FEZ soundtrack, Vangelis scored a futuristic score that was meant to capture the essence of a dark, decaying science fiction world. Since then, Disasterpeace has been releasing soundtrack after soundtrack that cannot be traced directly back to Vangelis’ work, to games and films that are more of fusions between science fiction and fantasy than hard science fiction, but still feel as though they’d still be appropriate to play in your average street market hawking cybernetic implants and limbs. How did this happen? Did Vangelis’ style in the Blade Runner soundtrack disseminate into the minds of the musicians he influenced, swirling around in the zeitgeist until it somewhat remanifested itself as a spiritual successor in Disasterpeace’s music? Or does Disasterpeace represent a shift in the zeitgeist, effortlessly capturing a sound which reflects his perceptions of a world that Vangelis had to envision through creative force? Is Disasterpeace’s body of work the true soundtrack to a dying world? But, most importantly: I just really really really want Disasterpeace to write a cyberpunk video game soundtrack. I’d lose my shit. As you may have noticed, I gave y’all a double dose of dystopian music last month to make up for May’s unceremonious gap. New to StaDW? Want more? Check the rest out here, and if you’ve got suggestions for more music to accompany our cyberpunk world as it is, leave them in the comments.

How about synthwave? Do you like soaring across the vast, vector-graphic landscapes of the Grid? Of course you do, it’s the 21st century. Lucky for you, I got a new, 100% chem-free, A/V hyper-stim that might be up your alley. Me? I don’t touch VR. Too paranoid that I’ll get brainjacked by the bootlickers, the megacorps, or some fucker with a laptop in a Starbucks halfway across the world. But I don’t judge, I’m probably crazy anyway. Anyways, from what people tell me, this Synth Riders stuff hits pretty nice. And hey, not everyone’s too privy to this data just yet–this is coming straight from those FiXT guys, the ones who put together the audio part of the sim. They just came out with some new recodes, each one hits a little different. They’ve already got a few different varieties on the market, but they sent me their part of what they’re developing with RetroWave VR, Inc. to be distributed through the Kluge Corporation. Here, have a taste: Now I’m not always into these kinda soundbytes, but I thought these were pretty even keel varieties across the board. They all give you a little bit of that industrial vibe and a bit of a rush, but I gotta say my favorite is “Free”. Don’t get me wrong, there’s a lot of craftsmanship in the way each track is put together, but the passion Raizer put into his coding really hits the spot. Anyways, I poked around the shadier parts of the internet to see what this whole Synth Riders thing is all about. Apparently it’s a sim within a sim where you play as a hacker that’s going up against this big bad machine intelligence that controls the world. I dunno, the guy who was last asking if I got some more stock in seemed pretty jittery. I think he started back when it first came to the streets, maybe he needed a fresh hit. Said something else about the rhythm, looks like this old movie from before they became obsolete, but better. Linked me to this: Makes you think, right? Like, what if we’re also in a simulation, and the cycle just somehow keeps continuing on and on and on until everything just loops back around… Anyway kid, if you’re interested, great. I got a couple plugs I can point you towards, the starter is on sale for like fifteen bucks and they’re gonna keep adding more for free. Crazy business model, right? It almost makes you feel like they’re doing this for fun. You want it, you be sure to drop my name, I get paid by commission. If you don’t, scram. We all gotta eat. Would you like to learn more?
