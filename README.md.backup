# CS-4395.001---Human-Language-Technologies---F22
## Course Description
Introduction to human language technologies (HLT), the study of natural languages from a computational perspective. Topics include computational models of syntax and semantics, natural language applications (such as machine translation, speech processing, information retrieval, and information extraction), and general machine-learning techniques commonly used in state-of-theart HLT research.
## Learning Objectives/Outcomes
1. Be able to perform morphological analysis
2. Be able to compute n-gram statistics and to perform smoothing
3. Demonstrate knowledge about parts-of-speech and ability to use and understand part-ofspeech
taggers
4. Demonstrate knowledge about various parsing algorithms and parsing techniques
5. Demonstrate knowledge of semantic representations including FrameNet, WordNet,
PropBank and semantic parsing techniques that employ them
6. Demonstrate knowledge about statistical machine translation
7. Be able to apply the NLP techniques to modern applications
