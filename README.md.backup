# Course Description

Introduction to human language technologies (HLT), the study of natural languages from a computational perspective. Topics include computational models of syntax and semantics, natural language applications (such as machine translation, speech processing, information retrieval, and information extraction), and general machine-learning techniques commonly used in state-of-theart HLT research.

# Learning Objectives/Outcomes

1. Be able to perform morphological analysis
2. Be able to compute n-gram statistics and to perform smoothing
3. Demonstrate knowledge about parts-of-speech and ability to use and understand part-ofspeech
taggers
4. Demonstrate knowledge about various parsing algorithms and parsing techniques
5. Demonstrate knowledge of semantic representations including FrameNet, WordNet,
PropBank and semantic parsing techniques that employ them
6. Demonstrate knowledge about statistical machine translation
7. Be able to apply the NLP techniques to modern applications

-	An introduction summarizing historical, current approaches to NLP and reflect on my personal interest in NLP [Overview of NLP.pdf](https://github.com/leonewtonz/CS-4395.001---Human-Language-Technologies---F22/blob/main/Assignments/Portfolio%20Setup/Overview%20of%20NLP_ldn190002.pdf)

## 2. Assignment 1 - Text Processing with Python
-	This program will read a .csv file which contains employees information. Then it will process the text to be more standardized. If the program can not auto format, it will ask user to re-enter the formattable values.
-	How to run:
	- Open terminal. Go to folder contains Homework1_ldn190002.py
	- Type in "python" to open python shell
	- Type in "py Homework1_ldn190002.py data/data.csv" to run the file.
	- Make sure the filepath data/data.csv is in the same folder with Homework1_ldn190002.py
	- Then follow the program's prompt
-	Python make it very easy to work with sysarg, and file I/O. It also have useful build-in libraries and methods to processing text file such as re, split(), splitline(), etc. However, in some cases, python will require extra step after the text was tokenize. That is NLTK is better option to processing text. For example: NLTK can perform the sentences segmentation way better then build-in python methods.
	- raw_text = 'Mr. Smith went to Dr. Jones. Dr. Jones was trained in the U.S.A.'
	- NLTK will not end a sentence on just any '.'.
	- The sent_tokenize(raw_text) will output ['Mr. Smith went to Dr. Jones.', 'Dr. Jones was trained in the U.S.A.']
	
-	This assignment gives me a quick review on how to work on sysarg and handle file I/O. It also provide very useful practice on how to process and format text. Writing a class in Python is very simple and similar with Java.
